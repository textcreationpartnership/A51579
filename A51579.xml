            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And becauſe thoſe heavenly things there treated upon were ſo ſtrange, neither did I ever finde, or read ſuch a kinde of language, not in all the ancient Fathers writings, and all who have undertaken to interpret the Scriptures, and eſpecially this book of the <hi>Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>In all my zeal in religion, which was very great, I found no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction neither in their writings, nor in their preaching, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> an evident ſign to me, that thoſe Preachers and Writers were not ſent of God.</p>
            <p>For certainly if they had, I ſhould have found reſt there, and ſo would many more; but I ſee all our preachers and teachers of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in religion they did, and do come ſhort of the glory of God, in that none of them hath, or can declare unto the people neither by writing, nor ſpeaking, what the true God is in his form and nature, nor the right devil his form and nature, not with all their wiſdom of reaſon, and great learning, and ſtudy of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>When as to know God, is life eternal, ſo that I know now by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that there is a great deal of difference between know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and thinking I know;</p>
            <p>For true knowledge it gives ſatisfaction to the ſpirit of man, and who ever knoweth the true God, muſt needs know the right devil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and womens ſpirits, is, they know not God, therefore they do not love God, but fear his anger they do not know.</p>
            <p>And as for the devil, they fear him to be ſome ſpirit flying in the air, even a fiction of their own brain: The imagination of reaſon thorow its ignorance hath created ſuch a devil to it ſelf, that the fear of it hath cauſed many men and women to looſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wits.</p>
            <p>When as indeed, and in truth, there is no devil but men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, neither doth any devil commit fornication, neither temporal nor ſpiritual with idols, but men and women; neither doth any devil perſecute and kill the Saints, or others, but men and women; ſo that there is no other devil to be damned to eternity, but men &amp; women.</p>
            <p>So that this is to be minded, that all the Scriptures as they were ſpoken by the holy Prophets, and Apoſtles, they were ſpoken to men and women, that is, to Saint, and devil, for the Scriptures were ſpoken to none but to theſe two.</p>
            <p>And theſe two are men, both Saint and devil, and yet all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of Scriptures cannot find what the devil is, nor where he is. And if they were well examined, they would hardly find where, and who are Saints.</p>
            <p>And all this ignorance that lieth upon the ſpirits of men and women, that produceth the trouble of mind, or that non-ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is becauſe the teachers of the people are ignorant, and blind themſelves in the knowedge of the true God, and the right devil, and of the true interpretation of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>So the myſteries of the Kingdom of eternal Glory is hid from their eyes, ſo that they have not ſatisfaction in themſelves, nor the people that hear them; ſo that whilſt they preach to others they themſelves are caſt-aways, or as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The blind leads the blind, and both fall into the ditch of eternal perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I confeſs they cannot help it, for it is the inſtinct of nature for the ſpirit of reaſon in man, to go to preach before he be ſent;</p>
            <p>And it is the inſtinct and nature of the Spirit of Faith, not to be willing to go on Gods Meſſages, when he is ſent of God.</p>
            <p>This I can experience to be truth in my ſelf, for I was the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingeſt man in the world to be publick, either in temporal things, or in ſpiritual matters, ſo that I was forced by a curſe from the Lord if I would not go.</p>
            <p>But now I ſee the ſame curſe did God lay upon all Prophets and
<pb facs="tcp:62818:3"/>
Meſſengers whom he had choſe, if they ſhould not obey to go where God would ſend them: witneſs <hi>Moſes, Jeremiah,</hi> and divers other Prophets, and as the Witneſſes of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>So that I would have the Reader to underſtand thus much, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> where a true Miniſter is, he is ſent of God, and the doctrine he doth bring, it giveth ſatisfaction unto himſelf, and to all thoſe that doth truly receive it.</p>
            <p>So on the contrary, that Miniſter that is not ſent of God, his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth neither ſatisfie himſelf, nor him that receives him t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> moſt peoples experience can witneſs unto.</p>
            <p>Elſe, as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, What meaneth the lowing of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>en, and the bleating of the ſheep in mine ears?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in like manner, if men were true Meſſengers of Chriſt, what meaneth the horror and torment of Conſcience, and the fear of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal damnation in the ſouls both of Miniſter and people?</p>
            <p>This many a Miniſter, and hearer of them, can witneſs unto.</p>
            <p>And all is, becauſe they were not ſent of God, for it is counted as great a ſin to run before a man is ſent of God, as it is not to go when he is ſent, which ſin is called rebellion, which is as bad as the ſin of witchcraft.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak this onely that the Reader, the Seed of Faith, may ſee the difference between thoſe Meſſengers that are not ſent of God, and their Doctrine, from thoſe that are ſent of God, and their Doctrine, and ſee which will ſatisfie the ſpirit beſt, for I know ſome hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of both, therefore they can tell beſt.</p>
            <p>For this is to be minded, that every true Prophet, or Meſſenger of Chriſt, can trace the footſteps of God in the Scriptures, for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the paths for Gods Spirit to walk in, and the paths of God are but three paths, to wit, the three Records in earth, Water, Blood, and Spirit.</p>
            <p>That is to ſay, the Commiſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Commiſſion of Jeſus and the Apoſtles, and the Commiſſion of the Spirit; theſe are the three paths which God doth walk thorow, which every Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Prophet could finde out God in that path he walked in: Thus when Gods Spirit walked thorow the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that being the path for Gods Spirit to walk in, the Prophets afterwards did finde him out in that worſhip of the Law.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe when Gods Spirit did walk in the path of the Goſpel,
<pb facs="tcp:62818:4"/>
the Apoſtles did finde him out in the Goſpel, and could trace his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tep in the paths of the Law: So that the Apoſtles found God out in thoſe two paths, aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Witneſſes of the Spirit have found God out in all his three paths, as thus: 1. The Prophets kept cloſe to the worſhip of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therein they found God. 2. The Apoſtles kept cloſe to the worſhip of the Goſpel, and therein they, found God. 3. The Witneſſes of the Spirit keeps cloſe to the worſhip of God in Spirit and truth: Theſe three Records on earth, are the three paths for God to walk in, and who ever doth walk in them ſhall finde him.</p>
            <p>Onely I would have the Seed of Faith to minde, what advantage one Commiſſion hath over another: the Commiſſion of the Goſpel had great advantage of thoſe in the Law.</p>
            <p>In that the Apoſtles knew the path of the Law, and the path of the Goſpel alſo, ſo that they had proofs from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that they were choſen to bear witneſs unto Jeſus, and that worſhip ſet up by them, when as <hi>Moſes</hi> had no books to proof he was choſen of God, but he had the power of miracles to prove he was ſent of God, and the Prophets after him had his writings, to prove that God had appeared to <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo that the Prophets could go no further then <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he that could trace the ſteps of God until he came to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was ſure to finde God there; but if any man went any further he could never finde God at all.</p>
            <p>So that the Apoſtles advantage was great in that they had two paths to walk in, when as the Prophets had but one: for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in their time did ſee that God would become fleſh, and the Apoſtles did ſee that God is become fleſh, ſo that their advantage was great. Thirdly, The Commiſſion of the Spirit hath advantage above them both in this reſpect, in that the worſhip of the Spirit is ſpiritual without any outward ordinances, ſo that the Spirit of Faith, or revelation, can walk thorow the path of the Law, and can finde that God was there, but he is not there now. Secondly, This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Spirit can walk thorow the worſhip of the Apoſtles, and do finde that God was there, but he is not there now.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, So that God is walking now in the third path, or third record on earth, even the Commiſſion of the Spirit, and there is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> for any man to finde God but there; for there is the

knowledge of the true God, and the true Interpretation of the Scriptures, ſo that this Commiſſion of the Spirit, it hath a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the other two aforeſaid, in that the knowledge of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a higher knowledge then that of the Prophets, and Apoſtles and the Interpretation of Scripture, more abundant then either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or Apoſtle, and more eſpecially the interpretation of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſions.</p>
            <p>For this the Seed of Faith may minde, that heavenly viſions are hard to utter by thoſe men that ſee them, but it is more hard for a man to interpret that which he never ſaw; for any mans reaſon would tell him, that it was more eaſie for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Belteſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet this gift was given them of God ſo to do.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe God hath given us the choſen Witneſſes of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, more knowledge in the Scriptures, then all the men in the world at this day: and not onely ſo, but God hath given me the gift of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>lation and Interpretation of many Viſions and Revelations in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ptures of truth, and more eſpecially in this Book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of Saint <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which book doth conſiſt of little elſe but heavenly Revelation, and ſpiritual will be, which if the Seed of Faith doth but minde, they will finde in this Treatiſe all the moſt conſiderable Revelations and Viſions, and myſtical ſayings in the Book of <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> opened and interpreted.</p>
            <p>So that who ever doth truly underſtand the interpretation of them may receive much ſatisfaction, as to diſcourſe in the Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with any learned man in the world, that ſpeaks the Engliſh tongue.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> doth ſpeak of things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> calls it <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt which God gave unto him, to ſhew unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> might well ſay that God did give it unto him, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is God, as he doth make it appear in his following Diſcourſe in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Alſo thoſe ſervants which he was to declare this Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt unto, I declare it was unto the Miniſters of thoſe Seven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and from them to the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>John</hi> doth ſpeak much of this Book of the Revelation by way of viſion, as well as revelation, and that doth make this Book of the Revelation to be the more difficult, and hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or to be interpreted.</p>
               <p>Therefore many wiſe and learned men have gone about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret ſome places of it, but have left the greateſt part of it as a ſealed Book which cannot be opened; and have left that which they have writ upon, as dark to the Reader as it was at firſt.</p>
               <p>And the cauſe is, they do not know what revelation which doth ariſe from the Seed of Faith is, neither can they diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween revelation and viſion; many other reaſons might be given why, but I ſhall let that paſs now.</p>
               <p>But to the matter in hand: It is ſaid that the knowledge of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>

great Myſteries ſhould be ſignified by his Angel unto his ſervant <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what this Angel was, I ſhall ſpeak ſome thing of it hereafter.</p>
               <p>But <hi>John</hi> was to beat record of the word of God, and of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all things that he ſaw: and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which <hi>John</hi> bear, it was to the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore he directed his Revelation to them, and his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was this, Grace be unto you, and peace from him, which is, and which was, and which is to come, and from the ſeven Spirits which are before his Throne.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is meant by him which is, and which was, and which is to come.</p>
               <p>This he, I declare was no other but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, this is he that is, becauſe he is now become fleſh, therefore he is called the Word of God, that is, the Word became fleſh, according to <hi>Johns</hi> ſaying, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Word became fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and this was Chriſt which is that word of God, which is God, and is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in that very ſame fleſh, which the eternal ſpiritual body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and ſuffered death in.</p>
               <p>And in this regard <hi>John</hi> did ſay, Grace and peace unto the ſeven Churches, from him <hi>that is,</hi> becauſe he is now become fleſh, and is now in heaven in that ſame body, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is ſaid, <hi>and which was;</hi> this Jeſus Chriſt is he that was alſo, as you may ſee <hi>Exodus</hi> 3.14. A little before in that chapter God doth ſend <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Pharoah, Moſes</hi> deſiring in whoſe name he muſt go, God giveth him this anſwer, <hi>God ſaid unto</hi> Moſes <hi>I am that I am: and thus ſhalt thou ſay to the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I am, hath ſent me unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>I am,</hi> I declare by Revelation, is no other but Jeſus Chriſt, and this is he <hi>which was;</hi> that is, he was without a body of fleſh at that time when he ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, yet he had a body when he ſpake to <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the form and likeneſs of a man.</p>

                  </gap>tance clear as chryſtal, and as I may ſay, ſwifter then thought, brighter than the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62818:10"/>Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> could not ſee his face and live, for a mortal eye-ſight cannot ſee an heavenly and ſpiritual glory; therefore there is no ſeeing nor knowing of God before he became fleſh, nor how he is aſcended up into the ſame glory, where he was before, but by faith onely.</p>
               <p>For no man can ſee the face of Jeſus now he is in glory, and live, no more then <hi>Moſes</hi> could ſee his face and live, before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came fleſh.</p>
               <p>And this Jeſus was <hi>that I am,</hi> that ſpake to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, and that God which was, that is, he was from eternity, and revealed to mankinde from the beginning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Jeſus is he which is to come, that is, he is to come to put an end to all time, that there might nothing but eternity remain; for as there was a beginning of time, ſo likewiſe there ſhall be an end of time; and as eternity had no beginning, ſo ſhall it have no ending.</p>
               <p>But here lyeth the great myſtery, that eternity became time, and time became eternity again.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, God became fleſh, and fleſh was in time, and Chriſt he being that fleſh of God, therefore called by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of <hi>John</hi> he which was before he became fleſh, he was God then under the title of God the Father.</p>
               <p>And after he did become fleſh, the <hi>Revelation of John</hi> doth ſay, <hi>He is</hi> that he is God now under the Title of God the Son, and as he is to come, he is God under the Title of God the Holy Spirit, yet theſe three are but one perſonal glory.</p>
               <p>They are all called by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> but he that is, which was, and which is to come.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did ſee by the eye of faith, that God was a ſpiritual body in the form of a man, and that this God would become fleſh, this I ſay they did ſee by the eye of faith, and ſo were very well ſatisfied: the truth of this may be underſtood by the eye of Faith, from that ſaying of <hi>Moſes</hi> unto the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where he ſayeth, God will raiſe you up a Prophet like unto me, him ſhall you hear.</p>
               <p>That is, God will become fleſh himſelf, ſo that he may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be a Prophet, that you may be the more capable to hear him; ſo likewiſe that place the 9. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he propheſieth of God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62818:11"/>
becoming fleſh, in that he ſaith, <hi>To us a childe is born, unto us a ſon is given; and the govenrment ſhall be upon his ſhoulder, and he ſhall be called the Mighty God, The everlaſting Father, The Prince of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did ſee by the eye of Faith, that God ſhould become a little childe. Great is this myſtery of God, but few that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it!</p>
               <p>For this Jeſus is the onely wiſe God, which is, which was, and which is to come, which hath waſhed every true believers ſoul in his own blood, neither can any thing cleanſe and purge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of man from the guilt of ſin, and fear of eternal death, but the blood of a God.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſpeak more of that hereafter, what ſhould be the meaning of thoſe Seven Spirits, which are before his Throne. I declare by Revelation, that thoſe Seven Spirits which were before the Throne of God, they were thoſe gifts and bleſſings of grace, which Chriſt gave unto the Miniſtery of the Seven Churches after his aſcenſion, as may plainly be read in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of <hi>Johns Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where he beginneth to write to the Seven Churches, and the Angel of every ſeveral Church; which Angel was the Miniſter; I ſay they had every one of them a ſeveral reproof, and a ſeveral gift and bleſſing; therefore I ſhall let the reproof alone, becauſe it would be too large to interpret.</p>
               <p>Onely I ſhall name the ſeveral Bleſſings, becauſe the ſeed of Faith may the better underſtand the interpretation of them, therefore I ſhall ſet them down in order.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt Gift and Bleſſing is ſent unto the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which is as followeth, <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi>

               <p>That Manna <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them to eat, it did ſignifie the Law by which the holy Angels did live by, and by that holy Law the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do live, that Law being written in their natures of pure reaſon.</p>
               <p>And by their feeding upon that Law, that is, by their perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God their Creator, they do live in his preſence for ever.</p>
               <p>So that the Manna that came down from Heaven, it was but a type or figure of the Angels Law written in their natures, by which they live in the preſence of God to eternity.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe there is a Law written in the nature and ſeed of faith, that is to ſay, in every true believer, and by this Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, he cometh to perfect obedience of faith, and ſo liveth by the faith of the Son of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>But I ſay true believers now they live by the faith of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo it may be called the faith of Gods elect.</p>
               <p>So that every true believer doth eat of the hidden Manna, that is, they eat the fleſh of Chriſt, for he is that bread that came down from heaven, that whoſoever doth eat thereof ſhall never dye.</p>
               <p>So that to ſpeak properly, the fleſh of Chriſt is that hidden Manna, and that refreſhments and aſſurance of eternal life, as I ſaid before, is but types and figures, as the other Manna was to the Jews.</p>
               <p>So that every one that doth truly believe in the true God, he doth eat of the hidden Manna: it may well be called hidden Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, for indeed it is hid from the greateſt part of the world, and very few there is that doth eat of it at all.</p>
               <p>For none doth eat of it but thoſe to whom it is given, but the Angels Manna is eaten of by every man and woman in the world: And as for this white Stone, this white Stone ſignifies clean hearts: as thus, whereas the heart before it was a heart of ſtone, or a ſtony heart, and not onely ſo, but it was a black ſtony heart
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62818:12"/>
defiled with ignorance, blindneſs, darkneſs, and unbelief.</p>
               <p>So that the heart was compaſſed about, and covered with the fear of hell, and torment of ſoul, and now this black or red ſtony heart, it is purified by faith in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>It having a new Law written in it, that is the Law of faith, and ſo cauſeth men to walk in Gods Statutes; which Statutes of God is to believe thoſe whom he ſends, and that Faith will purifie the heart of that ignorance, darkneſs, and unbelief.</p>
               <p>So that in ſpiritual matters the heart of man will become a white ſtone: it is called a white ſtone, becauſe it is cleanſed from thoſe things aforeſaid, and made white by faith in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>So that this white ſtone is no other but a new heart, or the old heart made new by the power of Faith.</p>
               <p>And as for the new Name that is written in this white ſtone: this new Name is a ſecret knowledge and aſſurance, that he is one of the redeemed of God.</p>
               <p>So that he hath the Name of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> written in his heart, even as all men have the Name of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> written in their hearts, becauſe all men are in the fallen ſtate by nature children of wrath.</p>
               <p>And ſo every man can read his name, in that he can read it in his own heart, they all being under the name of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the name of this ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> which is called <hi>A new Name, which none knoweth ſaving he that receiveth it,</hi> this experience will witneſs that no man can know that ſecret knowledge and aſſurance of his own redemption by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> but he that hath it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in him by the finger of Faith.</p>
               <p>So that all that do receive this white ſtone, they have this new Name written in it, which they themſelves can read to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joy and glory, though others cannot who have it not.</p>

               <p>Here thoſe that are ſtrong in faith, who holdeth out to the end in keeping Chriſts works, that is, who ever holdeth out to the end of his life, in ſuffering for the faith of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62818:13"/>He will give him that doth ſo, power over the Nations, and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron.</p>
               <p>That is, he by his faith and ſufferings ſhall have power over the Nations; although he looſe his life, yet he ſhall have power over the Nations, becauſe his ſufferings for truth ſhall lye ſo heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſciences of thoſe Nations that perſecute upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that ſhall be ruled as it were with a rod of iron; for there is rods of iron upon the ſpirits of men, as there is upon the bodies of men.</p>
               <p>For this rod of iron which breaketh mens ſpirits to pieces, even like a Potters veſſel, by wounding their conſciences with the guilt of innocent blood; ſo that the iron rod of Gods wrath will make them afraid of hell, and torment will ſeize upon them, and the fear of Gods eternal vengeance upon them, for this ſin of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood.</p>
               <p>So that all their peace, joy and comfort they had in this world, is broken in pieces by this iron rod of ſuffering for truth. For was not that Nation of the Jews, who put the Lord of Life to death, broken to pieces in the comfort of their ſouls, by that iron rod of Chriſts ſuffering death?</p>
               <p>And not onely ſo, but the temporal iron rod did break that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pieces a ſo in a few years after. Did not many of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that perſecuted the Apoſtles and Saints in the primitive times, had not they a rod of iron upon their hearts?</p>
               <p>And not onely ſo, but a temporal rod of iron which broke them to pieces, as to the peace of their mindes, and to their temporal peace alſo, as Hiſtories doth mention: ſo that ſuffering for truth it is as ſtrong an iron rod to break perſecuting ſpirits to pieces, even as a rod of iron doth break a Potters veſſel.</p>
               <p>For this is to be minded, that he that had the greateſt faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made uſe of any ſword of ſteel, nor any temporal rod of iron, but as the Sword of the Spirit doth cut mens ſouls both ways.</p>
               <p>So this rod of iron it is uſed in a ſpiritual ſenſe; for as words of truth doth cut men to the heart, as the Jews were at <hi>Peters</hi> words, ſo ſuffering for truth it doth bang the hearts of perſecuting men, even as a rod of iron, and breaketh all their peace and hope to pieces, even as a Potters veſſel.</p>
               <p>So that he that hath power to ſuffer for his faith, he ſhall break
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62818:13"/>
his enemies to ſhivers, both ſpiritual and temporal, even as Chriſt did by his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>And as Chriſt did conquer by his ſufferings over death, ſin, and hell; and not onely, but over thoſe perſecuting ſpirits which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be put to death.</p>
               <p>I ſay he brake all his ſpiritual and temporal enemies to pieces, even as a potters veſſel is broken to pieces with an iron rod.</p>
               <p>Even ſo it will be with every true believer whoſe faith doth hold out to the end, he ſhall conquer both ſin, death and hell in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and not onely ſo, but he ſhall rule his enemies without him as with a rod of iron, by keeping them under the fear of eternal death who perſecute for truths ſake.</p>
               <p>So that the peace and hopes of their mindes, by the patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Saints, will be broken in ſhivers, even as a Potters veſſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Chriſt will give him the Morning Star.</hi> This Morning Star is that Day-ſtar that doth ariſe in the heart, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>This Morning, or Day-ſtar is that light of truth, or light of the true God, that doth ariſe in the heart of every true Believer, and doth guide him in the right way; ſo that the ſoul is guided by the light of this Star in the way of truth here, even to the aſſurance of eternal life.</p>
               <p>And ſo the light of this Morning Star doth lead every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever into that eternal glory which God hath promiſed to all thoſe that do overcome thoſe ſpiritual enemies within, and all per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </epigraph>
               <p>AS for this white raiment, I ſhall ſhew what is meant by it in ſeveral places of this Treatiſe, and as for Chriſts not blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his name out of the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>And as for the Book of Life, and how mens names are written therein, the Reader ſhall finde in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62818:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>And as for his name not blotted out of the Book of Life, the meaning is this, That he that overcometh, as aforeſaid, ſhall not looſe the ſenſibleneſs of his name being written in the Book of Life, but ſhall have a certain aſſurance of it in himſelf.</p>
               <p>For when a man doth not know by faith that his name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of Life, that is, he having no aſſurance that he is of that Seed that ſhall be ſaved, he cannot truly ſay any otherwiſe but that his name is blotted out of the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>For though a mans name, as he is an elect Veſſel, is written in the Book of Life, yet he not knowing, it is to him as if it were blotted out of the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>So on the contrary, if any man ſhall vainly imagine that his name is written in the Book of Life, as moſt people in the world do, and he being of the contrary ſeed, his name is not written in the Book of Life; neither is he certain that it is not ſo.</p>
               <p>So that neither of theſe two, they being both uncertain of the thing in themſelves, their names may be ſaid to be blotted out of the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>For the Seed of Faith his name is written in the Book of Life, but he knows it not: and the ſeed of Reaſon his name is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of Life, yet he thinks it is, but doth not certainly know that it is not.</p>
               <p>So that to the apprehenſion of them both, their names are blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>For this I ſay, that except a man hath ſome witneſs in himſelf by voice from God, or ſome ſecret revelation, or by a ſtedfaſt faith in thoſe Meſſengers whom God doth ſend, he cannot know that his name is written in the Book of Life, but rather fear that his name is blotted out of it.</p>
               <p>So that the aſſurance that a mans name is not blotted out of the Book of Life, is when a man hath the witneſs in himſelf, that he knoweth the true God, and doth ſuffer perſecution for the truth, and not for a lye, as all the world doth.</p>
               <p>And ſo he that overcometh by faith and patient ſufferings for truth, he cometh to have the witneſs in himſelf that his name is written in the Book of Life, and that his name ſhall not be blotted out, no not by God himſelf.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62818:14"/>
                  <bibl>6.</bibl> Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out: and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, which is <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which cometh down out of Heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new Name.</q>
               <p>This Pillar in the Temple of God, it ſignifies the great ſtrength of faith and patience that was in the Church of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that their great faith ſhould enable them to ſuffer with ſuch patience, that they ſhould become a Pillar in the Temple of God, that is, their faith ſhould be as a Pillar to encourage, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and bear up thoſe that were more weak in faith, and more fearful to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>But he that overcometh ſhall be as a Pillar to bear up the weak, even as a Pillar of a Church of ſtone doth bear up the building that ſtandeth upon it.</p>
               <p>For the Temple of God is no other but true Believers: they are called by the Spirit <hi>The Temple of God;</hi> and he that is ſtrong in faith, and doth overcome all perſecution by patient ſuffering for his faith in God, he ſhall be made a Pillar to help bear up the Church of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſhall go no more out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, he ſhall go no more out from being a Pillar, but he ſhall be eſteemed of God a ſtanding Pillar in his Temple to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>So that God will write upon him his own Name, and the name of the City of God: The Name of God is to be a King, Prieſt, and Prophet.</p>
               <p>So that he that overcometh, as aforeſaid, ſhall have this name written upon his heart, King, Prieſt, and Prophet unto God.</p>
               <p>And as for the name of the City of God, <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> which cometh down out of Heaven from God; which <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> I have opened what it is, in the <hi>Interpretation of the Eleventh of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the New Name God will write upon him, I have ſhewed what it is before.</p>

                  <bibl>7.</bibl> To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſate down with my Father in his Throne.</q>
               <p>Here the Reader may ſee what the Spirit doth mean by <hi>overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</hi> That is, he overcometh ſin, death, and hell within himſelf; theſe being principalities and powers within a man.</p>
               <p>Alſo he overcometh all perſecution, and the malice of the devil, the ſpirit of reaſon without a man.</p>
               <p>Theſe things, I ſay, are overcome by the power of Faith, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering patiently for truth, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>For this was the way that Chriſt did <hi>overcome</hi> all his enemies, and when he had overcome by his death ſin, in that he dyed unto ſin.</p>
               <p>And he overcome death, in that he was deaths death.</p>
               <p>Alſo he overcame hell, in that the grave was not able to hold him under.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid by the ſpirit, <hi>Oh death, I will be thy death, oh grave, I will be thy victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo he overcame by his ſufferings the ſpirit of reaſon, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who always perſecuted the Prophets and Saints; I ſay he overcometh by his death this ſpirit of reaſon, the devil, in that he hath procured by his death an eternal damnation to all perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpirits.</p>
               <p>So that he hath overcome them, and will kill them with a ſecond death, where will be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth for evermore.</p>
               <p>And he overcometh theſe enemies aforeſaid, he is ſate down in the Throne of the Father.</p>
               <p>That is, he is ſate down in the ſame Glory, as he had when he was the Creator, or the ſame Glory which he had before the world was.</p>
               <p>Even ſo in like manner ſhall every Prophet, Apoſtle, and Saint that overcometh thoſe enemies aforeſaid, by the power of his Faith, and his patient ſufferings for truth.</p>
               <p>To him will Chriſt grant to ſit with him in his Throne; that is, he ſhall ſit with Chriſt, or be with Chriſt in the Kingdom of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory.</p>
               <p>Even as he himſelf after his ſufferings, is ſate down in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which he had before the world was.</p>

               <p>Thus in ſhort I have given the Interpretation, what is meant by thoſe ſeven ſeveral Bleſſings, given by the Spirit to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and how they all differ one from another, and yet all have relation to one and the ſame thing, even to eternal happineſs, joy and glory in the preſence of Almighty God, their God, their King, and Redemeer.</p>

               <p>I Would have the Seed of Faith alſo to underſtand, that Chriſt the onely God is he which did ſend forth theſe ſeven Spirits unto the ſeven Churches. Therefore called by the Revelation of <hi>John,</hi> the ſeven Spirits which are before his Throne. The ſeven Spitits, I declare by Revelation that they are but one Spirit, even the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, the onely wiſe God bleſſed for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Onely this I would have the Seed of Faith to underſtand, that this one ſpirit of Chriſt it hath ſeven ſeveral operations or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the ſeven Churches.</p>
               <p>Therefore called by the Revelation of <hi>John,</hi> ſeven Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne.</p>
               <p>Therefore you may read that <hi>John</hi> in his writing to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> giveth ſeven ſeveral Bleſſings as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe he cometh with his meſſage to the ſeven Churches, with ſeven ſeveral titles, and yet all from one God and one Spirit.</p>
               <p>As thus: Firſt, he writeth to the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> with this title, <hi>Saith he, that holdeth the ſeven Stars in his right hand, who wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the middeſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſtick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Golden Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches. Is there any ſpirit that can walk in the middeſt of the hearts of the ſeven Churches but the Spirit of Chriſt, which is God? ſurely no.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>John</hi> writeth to the Church of <hi>Smirna, Theſe things ſaith the firſt and the laſt, which was dead, and is alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not Jeſus Chriſt the firſt and the laſt? Was not he dead and roſe again? And ſo is alive? Surely it is. This was the ſaith of

                  <hi>John,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, and it is my faith alſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>John</hi> writeth theſe things unto the Church in <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos, Saith he who hath the ſharp Sword with two edges.</hi> This Sword with two edges, it cometh out of Chriſts mouth, I ſuppoſe all men that profeſs the Scriptures will confeſs it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Unto the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> he writeth, <hi>Theſe things ſaith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine braſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Spirit of Chriſt gives himſelf forth under the title of his Son-ſhip, but to the former Churches he gives himſelf forth under the title of the Father-hood.</p>
               <p>Yet under the title of the Son-ſhip, he is exceeding glorious, ſeemingly more glorious and terrible, then under the title of God the Father.</p>
               <p>For here his eyes are like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like fine braſs; yet all this while it is he, the ſame he which is the firſt, and the laſt, that is cloathed with fleſh and bone, yet a glorified body in the heavens above the Stars.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Unto the Angel of the Church in <hi>Sardis</hi> write, <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Stars.</hi> This he is Chriſt the firſt, and the laſt, he that was dead and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, this is he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeven Stars.</p>
               <p>Who can have the ſeven ſpirits of God, but he that is God? And who can rule and govern the ſeven Stars which are the ſeven Churches, but God onely?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, To the Angel of the Church in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> write, <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the Key of</hi> David, <hi>he that openeth, and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe that all men which profeſs the Scriptures will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that this muſt needs be God; he which is Holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of <hi>David:</hi> who can ſhut up the minde of man in ignorance and darkneſs, as he doth the wiſe and prudent men of this world; and no man can open their underſtandings.</p>
               <p>Alſo he can open the underſtandings of the Seed of Faith, and let the light of life ſhine into their hearts, and no man can ſhut up their hearts.</p>

               <p>Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>Amen,</hi> the true and faithful witneſs, he is alſo the beginning of the Creation of God, becauſe he is, and was that God that created the world, and all things therein in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

               <p>THus in ſome meaſure I have opened what is meant by him which is, which was, and which is to come, and what is meant by the ſeven Spirits before his Throne.</p>
               <p>It will be neceſſary to open ſomething what is meant by his Throne.</p>
               <p>The Throne of Chriſt I declare is where he is, as it is with an earthly King; where the King is, there is his Throne, eſpecially where the King doth ſit in Judgement upon any matters of life and death.</p>
               <p>But if he be not there in his own perſon, yet his Arms is ſet over every place of Judicatory, and the Judge of that place doth ſit under the Kings Arms, repreſenting the perſon of the King.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Judge fits in the Kings Throne.</p>
               <p>Yet it may be ſaid that the Kings Throne is there alſo, for the Kings Throne is all over his Dominions and Kingdoms, though he himſelf be but in one particular place, where his honor, and glory, and greatneſs may be moſt manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And that place where his glory is moſt ſeen, and where he doth uſually ſit in Judgement, I ſay that place may properly be called the Kings Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62818:17"/>For if the king were not a perſon, and had a kingdom, how could he ſet up a Throne in it?</p>
               <p>And if there be a Throne ſet up in a kingdome, there muſt of neceſſity be a King to ſit upon it.</p>
               <p>And this King muſt be the perſon of a man, elſe why ſhould we call him a King?</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he being God and Man in one ſingle perſon, he hath a kingdom above and beyond the Stars, and he being King of heaven, he hath a Throne to ſit upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>And many other Thrones in his kingdom above the Stars for all his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Meſſengers which he hath ſent in this world.</p>
               <p>Even as a King hath many Judges and Meſſengers in his earthly kingdom, and the King hath given them many Thrones to ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which are viſibly ſeen by the eye of ſence and reaſon:</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the eye of Faith doth as perfectly ſee God their King ſitting upon his Throne in the kingdom of glory above the Stars, and all thoſe Prophets, and Apoſtles, Meſſengers, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors which he hath ſent, to ſit upon Thrones of glory alſo.</p>
               <p>So that there is Thrones of Glory in Heaven, as there is here on earth; and there is a King of heaven to ſit upon that Throne of Glory, as there is many kings here in earth which doth ſit upon Thrones of glory here.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this world is in many Kings hands, therefore divided into many Kingdomes; and that is the very cauſe that earthly Kings fight, and kill one the other.</p>
               <p>But the Kingdom above the Stars is but one kingdom, and hath but one King over it, and this King is no other but God himſelf, which ſitteth upon the Throne of Glory.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak ſomething more of Thrones hereafter, therefore I ſhall ſay no more of it here, onely this will give you a little light into it.</p>

               <p>ANd becauſe men might be throughly convinced that Jeſus Chriſt is the onely God, I would have them to conſider theſe places of Scriptures, and the interpretation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62818:18"/>And ſee if they will bear any other ſenſe; and being well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that, they will underſtand the whole matter the better.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall paſs by ſome verſes in this chapter, I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them to be of ſo great concernment as this is.</p>
               <p>The 8th verſe of this chapter, <hi>John</hi> meaning Chriſt, where he ſaith, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning, and the ending, ſaith the Lord which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you that have faith to believe, may underſtand that Jeſus Chriſt is the beginning and the end, the Lord Almighty.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>John</hi> being in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> as he ſaith in the 9th verſe, <hi>for the word of God, and for the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> here <hi>John</hi> ſeemeth as if he did ſuffer perſecution for two, that is to ſay, for God, and for Jeſus Chriſt, yet in the 10. and 11. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he concludes them both in one, ſaying, That he was in the ſpirit on the Lords day, and heard behinde me, as he ſaith, a great voice as of a trumpet.</p>
               <p>I would have the Reader to obſerve that the Seventh-day, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath which was given to the Jews, was called the Lords day.</p>
               <p>Becauſe it was given by the Lord Almighty to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him given to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo called the Lords day.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Reſurrection of Chriſt, it being the firſt day of the week, is called the Lords day alſo.</p>
               <p>Now here being two Lords-days, and yet but one Lord of them both, how ſhall this matter be reconciled?</p>
               <p>Thus the Lords-day which was made by the power of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is one thing, and the Lords-day that is made by the power of his Redemption is another.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Lord Almighty was in two ſeveral ſtates: as thus, when he created the world, and made man in his own image and likeneſs, he himſelf was a ſpiritual ſubſtance; a body in form like a man, but no fleſh, blood and bone.</p>
               <p>This God was when he created man, and all things elſe; but when God became fleſh, he was in another condition, he now having fleſh, blood and bone, that he might work a Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> to a more excellent condition then that was wherein he was created, and a more miſerable condition to the ſeed of the ſerpent, then he was created in.</p>
               <p>And this I would have the Seed of Faith to underſtand, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62818:18"/>
the ſame God which created man, I ſay, the ſame God redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man; which thing is two proper and diſtinct works for one and the ſame God to do.</p>
               <p>Therefore diſtinguiſhed by two ſeveral denominations, of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Son.</p>
               <p>Neither was it proper for God after he became fleſh, to create any thing.</p>
               <p>Neither could God have redeemed mankind to an eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but by his becoming fleſh.</p>
               <p>Neither could any ſerpent or devil have put God to death, if God had not took upon him the nature of man.</p>
               <p>For the nature of man cloathes it ſelf with fleſh, blood and bone, and ſo is made capable to be put to death by the ſeed and nature of reaſon; which is the ſerpent, or devil.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſpeak more of Gods death hereafter, onely this I would have the Seed of Faith to minde that twofold condition of God, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And then you will not ſtumble at <hi>Johns</hi> ſaying, <hi>that he did ſuffer for the word of God, and for the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if they had been two diſtinct things, and ſo he doth in ſome other places in this book of the Revelation, as in the firſt chapter verſe 5, he ſaying, <hi>And from Jeſus Chriſt, who is the faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Which doth intimate to the ſeed of reaſon, as if there were two Gods.</p>
               <p>But I declare it is ſpoken with relation to Gods twofold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that is to ſay, the proper power and work of God, as he was the Father, it was to create.</p>
               <p>And the proper power and work of God, as he is the Son, it is to die, and to redeem.</p>
               <p>And yet all but one God, but in two conditions or in two ſtates, therefore ſet forth by the revelations in the Scriptures under no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Father and Son.</p>
               <p>Therefore I would willingly have the Seed of Faith to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the twofold condition of God.</p>
               <p>And then the Scriptures, which doth ſeem to contradict one the other, will be reconciled in one, and ſo there will be a great deal of peace ariſe from the right underſtanding of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62818:19"/>And the cauſe why where is ſo much diſſatisfaction in reading the Scriptures, by the profeſſors now adays, it is becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them not: this I know by experience.</p>
               <p>But as I ſaid before, as there was a twofold ſtate in one God,</p>
               <p>So likewiſe there was two Lords-days as aforeſaid, yet but one God.</p>
               <p>But the meaning of <hi>John</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>he was in the ſpirit on the Lords day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I declare his meaning was the day of Chriſts Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>And this he calls <hi>the Lords-day,</hi> that is, it was the day of Gods riſing from death to Life, in that death was not able to keep him under; for death doth keep every creature under it, neither could any creature nor Son of God overcome death, but God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt muſt needs be God the Father of all Life, in that he gave life to all creatures in his creation.</p>
               <p>And nothing could procure by his death a Reſurrection of a new life, and an eternal Redemption, but the blood and death of God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the Seed of Faith lay as much truſt upon the blood of Chriſt, believing it to be the blood of God, as they can.</p>
               <p>The more weight they lay upon it, the more peace and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they ſhall finde.</p>
               <p>So on the contrary; thoſe that deny and call it blaſphemy for a man to ſay that God did die, I ſay there is no ſalvation for ſuch a man, neither will he finde any benefit by the blood of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he looks upon it to be but the blood of the humane nature, or the blood of a man; notwithſtanding the Scriptures is ſo full to prove that Chriſt is God, and Chriſt he died, therefore God did die.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> is more clear that God did die, then any other Scripture, as you may ſee in the 11. verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: in the 10. verſe he was in the Spirit on the Lords day, what day that was I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And <hi>John</hi> heard behind him a great voice as of a Trumpet in the 11. verſe, ſaying, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt, and what thou ſeeſt write in a book, and ſend it unto the ſeven Churches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in the 12. verſe, <hi>John</hi> turned to ſee the voice that ſpake
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62818:19"/>
to him, and being turned he ſaw ſeven Golden Candleſticks, theſe ſeven Golden Candleſticks, were the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And in the 13. verſe, and in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks, one like unto the Son of Man, cloathed with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment down to the foot, and girt about the waſte with a Golden Girdle.</p>
               <p>This great voice which <hi>John</hi> heard, it being as the ſound of a trumpet, came from no other but from Jeſus Chriſt, the onely God, he being that <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which bade <hi>John</hi> write in a book what he had ſeen.</p>
               <p>And in the 12 verſe, <hi>John</hi> turned to ſee the voice, and in ſtead of ſeeing the voice, he ſaw him that ſpake the voice.</p>
               <p>And he was like unto the Son of Man cloathed with a Garment down to the foot.</p>
               <p>Now what this Garment is, I ſhall unfold hereafter: There is many other glorious expreſſions in this Chapter, to ſet forth this Son of Man in his glory, but I ſhall paſs by them, onely this I would have the Seed of Faith to minde, that this Son of Man which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks, who was cloathed with a Garment down to the foot.</p>
               <p>I declare it was the ſame <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> which ſpake that great voice, and <hi>John</hi> turning to ſee this <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> he ſaw him like unto the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>Therefore I would have the Seed of Faith to obſerve that there is no ſeeing of God, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> neitheir by viſion nor by faith, but in the form of a man.</p>
               <p>Therefore called <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> ſo that though Chriſt be called the Son of Man, yet he is nevertheleſs God.</p>
               <p>For he is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> as you may plainly ſee in the 17. verſe of this chapter,</p>
               <p>Where he ſaith, <hi>And when I ſaw him, I fell at his feet as dead, and he laid his right hand upon me, ſaying unto me, Fear not, I am the firſt and the laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Amen, and have <hi>the Keys of hell and of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you that have faith in the true God, may clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that this Jeſus Chriſt, which is called the Son of Man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62818:20"/>Alſo it may be as clearly underſtood by the Seed of Faith, that God did die.</p>
               <p>For if God be <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> as I think all men will confeſs, then I ſay the ſame <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> and the ſame <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt,</hi> is he which was dead and is alive for evermore.</p>
               <p>And was there any God that ſuffered death and roſe again, but Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Hath any God the keys of hell and of death in his hands, but Chriſt onely?</p>
               <p>And that you may ſee the truth of this, that Chriſt is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> though become a Son, having fleſh, blood, and bone, that he might be capable to ſuffer the pains of death, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Yet he is looked upon by the eye of Faith, to be the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> the Lord Almighty, he being the ſame as the Prophets propheſied of, as you may ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 41. and 4. verſe, <hi>Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the Lord the firſt, and with the laſt, I am he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe in the 44. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and the 6 verſe, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and his Redeemer the Lord of hoſts, I am the firſt, and I am the laſt, and beſides me there is no God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have the Seed of Faith to underſtand that this Lord, and this God, which is the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh of, is the ſame that <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> onely the Prophet ſpeaketh of him as he was in the condition of the Father, and was to redeem his people from their ſins; but <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of him as he is a Son, and that he hath ſuffered death, and redeemed his people.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>John</hi> calls him the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> as he was a Son and ſuffered death, but is now alive for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet all but one God, even the the man Chriſt Jeſus, who is that <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>beginning</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> he who was dead and is alive, and behold he is alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

               <p>And as for what <hi>John</hi> did write to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> it is ſet down in the two chapters following: thoſe two chapters treating onely upon the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the chief things in thoſe two chapters I have interpreted already, and the chief things which are of moſt concernment in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have alſo interpreted; therefore I ſhall go to the 4th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but I ſuppoſe it will be neceſſary to the Reader, for me to ſhew what a reſemblance and likeneſs there is between the ſeven Churches now in <hi>Europe</hi> in theſe our days, and the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how the Angels of the ſeven Churches, which is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or Speakers, do agree with the ſeven Angels of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> I have ſpoken ſomething of them in the <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the</hi> 11th <hi>of the Revelation,</hi> but I ſhall ſpeak a little more of them here, becauſe it is ſomething neceſſary to inform the Reader.</p>
               <p>Therefore minde the diſtinction between the one and the other.</p>
               <p>We read that the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had ſeven ſeveral names, as may be read, and according to their good practice, and their bad, they were either reproved or commended, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Miniſters of the Seven Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> may be called ſeven Angels; for the Miniſtry of every Church, let it be one or more, it is called but one Angel.</p>
               <p>And every one of theſe ſeven Churches hath a ſeveral Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, therefore diſtinguiſhed by theſe ſeveral names as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62818:21"/>1. <hi>Papiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> 3. <hi>Presbytery.</hi> 4. <hi>Independent.</hi> 5. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</hi> 6. <hi>Ranter.</hi> 7. <hi>Quaker.</hi> Now the Miniſtery of theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> though they be Angels, yet they are but Anti-Angels, in oppoſition to the ſeven true Angels.</p>
               <p>Neither are the ſeven Churches themſelves true Churches, but Anti-Churches in oppoſition to the ſeven true Churches in <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon why theſe Churches are not true Churches, is, becauſe they have no true Miniſtery; and the cauſe why they have no true Miniſtery, is, they have no Commiſſion from God to preach the everlaſting Goſpel, as the Angels of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had.</p>
               <p>For there can be no true Church without a true Miniſter; for a true Miniſter having a Commiſſion from God, maketh a true Church:</p>
               <p>But thoſe that receive their Commiſſion from man, which is not ſent of God, is no true Miniſter, neither is his Church any true Church.</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe which take upon them to be Miniſters of the Goſpel without a Commiſſion either from God, or from man; when I ſay man, I mean from the King, or Head-Magiſtrate, who gives Commiſſions to men to be Preachers,</p>
               <p>I ſay that theſe men which take upon them the Miniſtery by reading the Letter of the Scriptures, or by any natural learning, wit, or light within, or gift whatſoever, without a Commiſſion from God,</p>
               <p>I ſay, they are worſe than thoſe that have their Commiſſion from the Magiſtrate, as the <hi>Baptiſt, Ranter,</hi> and <hi>Quaker:</hi> theſe three have no Commiſſion to preach the everlaſting Goſpel neither from God, nor from man;</p>
               <p>Yet they are Miniſters of thoſe three Churches, and ſo called Angels; ſo that there is ſeven Angels of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> as there was of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is to ſay, the Angel of the Church of the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Church of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> the Angel of the Church of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> the Angel of the Church of <hi>Independents,</hi> the Angel of the Church of <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> the Angel of the Church of <hi>Ranters,</hi> and the Angel of the Church of <hi>Quakers.</hi> Theſe ſeven Churches having all of them a Miniſtery differing one from another in point of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62818:21"/>
practice and diſcipline. But in point of doctrine they all agree.</p>
               <p>For as to that, they are all ignorant of the true God, therefore cannot preach no true doctrine, they having no Commiſſion from God, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Angels of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> they did all of them differ one from the other in point of practice and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but did all agree in point of doctrine.</p>
               <p>They having the knowledge of the true God. And why did they know the true God? becauſe they had a true Miniſtery to preach unto them. And why was their Miniſtery true any more than theſe now adays?</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Angels or Miniſters of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> received their Authority and Commiſſion to preach from Heaven, which was from Chriſt himſelf after he was aſcended, as you may read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and as I have largely opened in <hi>The Interpretation of the</hi> 11 <hi>Chapter of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſeven Angels or Miniſtery of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> take up their Miniſtery by tradition, imitating the true Miniſtery, aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Therefore but Anti-Angels, ſeeming to be true, but are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither will that Miniſtery which taketh it up by tradition, having no Commiſſion from God, receive that bleſſed reward as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſhall, but altogether to the contrary.</p>
               <p>For when they ſhall ſay, <hi>Lord, we have preached in thy name, and prayed in thy name, and caſt out devils, and have done many wondrous things in thy name, Chriſt will ſay, Depart from me ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I know you not;</hi> for Chriſt will not know thoſe which he doth not ſend.</p>
               <p>For it is a dangerous thing for a man to take upon him to be a Miniſter of Chriſt, when as he ſent him not; but this hath been the practice and cuſtom of men ſo to do this thirteen hundred and fifty years.</p>
               <p>And this traditional Miniſtery of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> are the ſeven Anti-Angels which were to ſound after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, whereof ſix of them hath ſounded already, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth doth now ſound; the Quakers Miniſtery being the ſeventh and laſt Anti-Angel that will ſound till time be no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62818:22"/>Their Miniſtery ſeeming to carry the moſt pureſt ſhew of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of life, but the worſt and moſt curſed of all the ſeven Churches in <hi>Europe</hi> in point of doctrine.</p>
               <p>For their Miniſtery doth deny both the Father and the Son to be a perſon in the form of a man without them; for they have got God and Chriſt all within them, ſo that they minde no perſon of Chriſt without them.</p>
               <p>As I have opened more large in <hi>The Interpretation of the</hi> 11th <hi>Chapter of the Revelation,</hi> and in <hi>The Quakers Neck broken,</hi> where I have ſhewed that they are led and guided by the ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt more in point of doctrine, than any other of the ſix Churches aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And the Quakers Miniſtery being the ſeventh and laſt Anti-Angel that will ſound in oppoſition, or by way of imitating the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Angels of <hi>Aſia;</hi> for there muſt be ſeven Anti-Angels as well as ſeven true.</p>
               <p>That is, there was a Miniſtery that hath a Commiſſion from Chriſt to preach unto the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that was a true Miniſtery; there is alſo a Miniſtery of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> which have no Commiſſion from Chriſt to preach, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not true.</p>
               <p>Yet called ſeven Angels by the <hi>Revelation of John,</hi> in the tenth chapter and the ſeventh verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>But in the dayes of the voice of the ſeventh Angel, when he ſhall begin to ſound, the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed, as he hath declared to his ſervants the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have the Reader to underſtand, that <hi>John</hi> did not mean when the ſeventh Angel of the Church of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſounded, that then the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed; for the ſeven Angels of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſounded many hundred yeares ago, and yet the myſtery of God was not finiſhed then.</p>
               <p>But his meaning was when the ſeven Anti-Angel ſounded, who hath no Commiſſion to preach, then the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed, as he had declared by his Prophets.</p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to underſtand, that preaching is called by the <hi>Revelation of John</hi> a ſounding: and doth not the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> lift up their voices, as with a trumpet?</p>
               <p>As if they were true Miniſters of Chriſt, when as they do but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62818:22"/>
imitate the true Angels ſounding; for the Miniſtery of all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> are falſe, becauſe they have no Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Chriſt to be Preachers, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Yet the Miniſtery of every Church is called an Angel, but they are but Anti angels, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay unto me, If the Miniſters and Speakers of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> be all falſe for want of a Commiſsion from God, what will become of all the people which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated and joyned to their ſeveral Miniſteries?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer: That there is a remnant of the elect ſeed in every one of theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> that wilbe ſaved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the election of God ſtandeth ſure; but this I muſt tell you, that there is no man or woman that is congregrated or joyned to any of theſe ſeven Churches, that can have the aſſurance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life abiding in them, while they live in this world.</p>
               <p>For how is it poſſible that the ſheep ſhould know their eternal happineſs, when as the ſhepheards do not know their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no not one of them.</p>
               <p>Therefore according to my revelation and faith, I cannot ſee by the rule of Scriptures, that any of the Miniſters or Speakers of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> now adays, that can be ſaved, though ſome of their members may.</p>
               <p>This may, and will be thought an hard ſaying of me, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it; neither do I ſpeak it out of any ill will to Miniſters or Speakers, but could rather be found a liar in this point.</p>
               <p>But I being commiſſionated of God, and finding the Prophets and Apoſtles of old to ſpeak ſo much againſt thoſe, which take upon them to be Meſſengers, Miniſters, Ambaſſadors, and Preachers of the everlaſting Goſpel, without a Commiſſion from Chriſt, they are more guilty of ſpiritual high treaſon then any other men; ſo according to the faith of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and my faith, I cannot ſee how any counterfeit Miniſters of what Church ſoever, ſhould be ſaved in the day of account.</p>
               <p>For if it be ſuch a dangerous thing to be a falſe Prophet, or a falſe Chriſt, why ſhould it not be as dangerous a thing to be a falſe Miniſter, to go before he is ſent.</p>
               <p>And let Miniſters take this by the way, and though the Civil Power doth uphold and maintain them, yet when they die, God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62818:23"/>
will not uphold them in it. Neither will their conſciences juſtifie them in it; but you muſt lay down your lives under the fear of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, becauſe you went to preach the Goſpel, and was not ſent of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe you ſee that falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets have been puniſhed in all ages, by the Civil Magiſtrates and the Prieſts together.</p>
               <p>And ſo they ſerved the true Chriſt, and the true Prophets; all of them were perſecuted as falſe.</p>
               <p>But it is ſeldom known that a Miniſter was perſecuted as he is a Miniſter, not by the Magiſtrate, but for ſome other miſdemeanor, or for ſpeaking evil of the Civil Power, but not for his preaching without a Commiſſion from Cod.</p>
               <p>Therefore his puniſhment will be no leſs then eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak this not onely to the Miniſtery of the Nation, but to the Miniſtry of all the ſeven Churches now in <hi>Europe;</hi> for they do all of them preach without a Commiſſion from God, and run into the Miniſtry before they were ſent, which will be counted by the Lord Jeſus but a work of iniquity.</p>
               <p>And what will be the wages of ſuch a work but eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>I know I ſhall offend the Miniſters and Speakers of all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches aforeſaid, but ſeeing they be all falſe, they may bear the better with me, and with one another.</p>
               <p>For they will have wages all alike.</p>
               <p>For as I ſaid before, according to the faith of the Prophets and Apoſtles, recorded in the Scriptures, and according to the faith which I have in the Scriptures, there will be no ſalvation found for none of the Miniſters and Speakers of the ſeven Churches aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Except any of them be perſwaded in their own mindes to lay it down before they die,</p>
               <p>And ſo come to the knowledge of the true God.</p>
               <p>For this I do affirm that no man ſo long as he doth exerciſe the office of a Miniſter without a Commiſſion from God, he cannot be in the ſtate of ſalvation; then of neceſſity he muſt be in the ſtate of condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62818:23"/>And this will be the condition of all the Miniſters and Speakers of the ſeven Churches aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And the Quakers Miniſtry being the ſeventh and laſt Anti-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that will ſound, until the end of the world.</p>
               <p>And when the voice of this Angel did begin to ſound, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God is finiſhed, as he hath declared by his ſervants the Prophets.</p>
               <p>That is, the declaration of the myſtery of God is, and will be finiſhed in the days of the voice of the ſeventh Angel.</p>
               <p>Which voice is the Miniſters of the Quakers, as I have opened in the <hi>Interpretation of the Eleventh of the Revelation,</hi> therefore I ſhall ſay no more of thoſe ſeven Churches now.</p>
               <p>That being the pureſt Angel of all the ſeven in reſpect of righteouſneſs of life, though the worſt of all in point of doctrine.</p>
               <p>And the Quakers Miniſtery doth deceive more then any of the other ſix.</p>
               <p>For they are ſo Angel-and God-like, that if it were poſſible would deceive the very elect.</p>
               <p>For every one that hath but one eye, that is the eye of reaſon, may ſee that all the other Churches, hath ſuch a deal of corruption, ſuperſtition, unjuſtneſs, idolatry, and many other wickedneſſes, which reaſon it ſelf doth judge cannot be the way of God.</p>
               <p>And that is the very cauſe that when people have been unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the way of worſhip in the other Churches, they have decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from them, and have turned Quakers.</p>
               <p>They being more pure in life; for pureneſs of life giveth more peace to the minde of man then wickedneſs doth.</p>
               <p>For every action hath a reward in it ſelf, whether it be good or bad; for he that doth ſuffer perſecution for his conſcience, is more to be juſtified then he which perſecuted for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſs the reward of eternal life, it belongeth onely unto the act of faith in the true God.</p>
               <p>Which the Quakers Miniſtery doth not teach, notwithſtanding their purity of life, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>NOw I have opened ſomething what is meant by the ſeven Churches, and the Angels ſounding, in the next place I ſhall come to open or interpret ſome chief ſayings in the 4 chapter of <hi>Johns Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt verſe of this chapter, <hi>John looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the firſt voice which he heard, was as it were of a Trumpet talking with him, which ſaid, Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee the things which muſt he hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have the Seed of Faith to minde the interpretation of this chapter, and they will underſtand the better the meaning of the 5 and 6 Chapters. Firſt it is to be underſtood that <hi>John</hi> ſaw theſe great and glorious things by way of viſion.</p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to underſtand, that viſions are hard to be interpreted by one that never ſaw them.</p>
               <p>Yet as far as the revelation of faith can open them, I ſhall do it; which I know is more then any man in the world can do at this day, or ſhall hereafter to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the Reader doth but underſtand the ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and meaning of <hi>Johns</hi> viſions, though not every particular circumſtance, I ſay, it will give full ſatisfaction to the minde of man as to the Scriptures, and to their eternal ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his Viſion, it was a door open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heaven: Now I would have the Seed of Faith to underſtand that there is a door belonging to heaven, and a door belonging to hell.</p>
               <p>Therefore called in Scripture the gates of heaven and of hell, as Chriſt ſaid unto <hi>Peter, I have given thee the Keyes of heaven and of hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe when the five fooliſh virgins came to the door where the Bridegroom was, but the door was ſhut upon them, ſo that they could not come in to that Eternal Marriage.</p>
               <p>So that there is a door belongs to Heaven, alſo there muſt be ſome body to open this door.</p>
               <p>It is much like unto a Kings Palace, where no inferior perſon can ſee into it except the Door-keeper do open the door.</p>
               <p>There is no earthly Kings Palace but hath a door to it, neither
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62818:24"/>
can any man ſee into it except the door be open<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Now as there is a door of earthly ſubſtance which may be ſeen and felt, belonging to every earthly Kings Palace, the Palace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earthly alſo, though decked and ſet forth very gloriouſly to the eye of Senſe and Reaſon, becauſe it belongeth to Reaſons kingdom;</p>
               <p>So likewiſe there is as real an Heavenly Palace above, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſtars, where Chriſt the King of Heaven doth ſit upon his Throne.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is a door belonging to it of a ſpiritual and heavenly ſubſtance, which may be ſeen, felt, and underſtood by the eye of Faith, as the other is by the eye of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid in Scripture by the Apoſtles, <hi>We ſpeak the things which we have ſeen, which we have heard, which we have taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which we have handled of the word of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there is as real a ſpiritual ſubſtance to be ſeen, taſted, and handled by the Seed of Faith in the minde, as there is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things by the ſeed of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe Chriſt is called a <hi>Door</hi> himſelf, and he hath the Key of <hi>Davia,</hi> who openeth and no man ſhutteth.</p>
               <p>And this is he that opened the door of <hi>Johns</hi> underſtanding, and let him ſee in a viſion the glory of heaven, and him that ſate on the Throne, as you may ſee in the ſecond verſe. For as ſoon as ever <hi>John</hi> had heard the voice, that is, as ſoon as ever the door of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was opened, the door of heaven was opened alſo.</p>
               <p>And the door of heaven being opened, there was preſented in a viſion to his ſight, few things that muſt be hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now what thoſe things which muſt be hereafter are, they are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the viſion in the chapters following;</p>
               <p>For the voice which talked with <hi>John</hi> in the viſion, bade him come up hither, and I will ſhew the things which muſt be hereafter.</p>
               <p>And immediately <hi>John</hi> was in the ſpirit, that is, he was ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed and wrapt up in his ſpirit w th the ſight of heaven, and the glory thereof in the viſion, the door of heaven being opened, that he was as <hi>Paul</hi> was, whether in the body, or out of the body, he could not tell.</p>
               <p>For <hi>John</hi> did ſee things unutterable, for indeed the things of Gods becoming fleſh, and ſuffering death, and the glorious effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62818:25"/>
they are unutterable; that is, the tongue of man cannot explain it, not as it is in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But men that have written the Scriptures, and have had viſions and revelations of theſe heavenly things, they have expreſſed them to the capacity of man, as they could by words.</p>
               <p>So that men might believe the things of God which are ſpiritual and eternal, by words of mortal men like themſelves.</p>
               <p>As men do underſtand one another in the things of this world.</p>
               <p>And the gift of interpretation of Scriptures, which was written by Revelation and Viſion, I ſay it is more profitable to man then the Scriptures themſelves;</p>
               <p>For what profit is it to a man to read another mans revelation or viſion, and know nothing of it himſelf? Therefore interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scriptures is the beſt, and moſt profitable gift unto the Seed of Faith now adays, to lead them unto their eternal reſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore to unfold ſomething more of <hi>Johns</hi> viſion in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe, <hi>And immediately he was in the ſpirit, and behold a Throne was ſet in heaven, and one ſate on the Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the 3 verſe he tells what he was like that ſate on the Throne, and in the 4 verſe he ſaith, <hi>And round about the Throne were four and twenty Seats, and upon the Seats</hi> John <hi>ſaw four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Elders ſitting, cloathed in white Raiment, and they had on their heads Crowns of Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the 5 verſe, <hi>There were ſeven Lamps of fire burning before the Throne, which are the ſeven Spirits of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the 6 verſe, <hi>And before the Throne there was a Sea of Glaſs like unto Chryſtal, and in the midſt of the Throne, and round about the Throne, were four Beaſts full of eyes before and behind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the 7 verſe, <hi>And the firſt Beaſt was like a Lion, and the ſecond beaſt like a Calf, and the third beaſt had a face like a Man, and the fourth beaſt was like a flying Eagle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 8 verſe, <hi>And the four beaſts had each of them ſix Wings about him, and they were full of eyes within, and they reſt not day and night, ſaying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 9 verſe, <hi>And when thoſe beaſts gave glory, and honor, and thanks to him that ſate on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall give a ſhort interpretation of theſe things afore mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62818:25"/>
In the ſecond verſe, <hi>John</hi> ſaw a Throne in heaven, and him that ſate thereon.</p>
               <p>You may remember how I have ſhewed before, that there is Thrones in heaven, as there is here in earth, and there is a Throne in ſpecial for the King of Heaven, as there is for a King here on earth.</p>
               <p>And he which <hi>John</hi> ſaw to ſit upon the Throne in Heaven, it was no other but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>John</hi> doth ſet him forth in the 3 verſe, <hi>that he was to look upon like a Jaſper, and a Sardine ſtone,</hi> with other glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; which is onely to ſet forth the glory of him that ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne.</p>
               <p>And in the 4 verſe, <hi>Round about the Throne were four and twenty Seats, and upon the Seats were four and twenty Elders ſitting, cloathed in white Raiment, and they had on their heads Crowns of Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is much like unto the Throne of an earthly King; for an earthly King hath many Seats for his Nobility to ſit on round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Throne, where he ſeats himſelf.</p>
               <p>And the Nobility doth fit in thoſe Seats, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and place.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Nobility have Crowns of Gold, upon their head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> though not ſo abſolute Crowns of Gold as the King himſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet they have a reſemblance and likeneſs of crowns, ſignifying that they are of the Blood Royal.</p>
               <p>So is it in heaven, the four and twenty Elders being of the Blood Royal, Co-heirs unto the kingdom of Heaven, they have Seats to ſit upon round about the Kings Throne.</p>
               <p>And as for the four and twenty Elders what they are, I have opened at large in <hi>the Interpretation of the eleventh of the Revelation;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall not ſpeak of them here: but as for their being cloathed in white raiment, the meaning of that is this:</p>
               <p>They were cloathed in their mindes, while they lived in this world with the righteouſneſs of Faith, which purifies the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And theſe four and twenty Elders being juſtified by faith in the blood of the Lamb, they may be ſaid to be cloathed in white r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62818:26"/>That is, they are pure and white in their ſouls, by being waſhed in the blood of the Lamb by faith, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>They have no guilt of ſin upon them at all, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in the 5 verſe it is ſaid, <hi>That there were ſeven Lamps of fire burning before the Throne, which are the ſeven Spirits of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning of thoſe ſeven Lamps which burned before the Throne, I declare they were the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, the ſouls of the true believers, which were of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> were thoſe ſeven Lamps which burned before the Throne.</p>
               <p>And the ſeven Spirits of God are thoſe ſeveral gifts of Graces, which he gave to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And that grace of faith and love, which God gave to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> it burneth in the lamps of their ſouls, before the Throne of God to eternity.</p>
               <p>For every ſoul is a lamp for the fire of Gods love to burn in, if there be but oyl in your Lamp, that is, if there be but faith in the heart.</p>
               <p>It will be a glorious place for the candle of the Lord, which is the ſpirit of God, to burn in, and happy will that man be that hath his Lamp burning before the Throne of God, as theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſhall.</p>
               <p>For this I would have the Seed of Faith to underſtand, that <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of things to come as if they were in preſent being.</p>
               <p>For viſions and revelations ſpeaketh of things at a diſtance, as if they were in preſent ſight.</p>
               <p>Becauſe God and Faith knows that time will be ſwallowed up into eternity.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that <hi>John</hi> doth ſay in his viſion, that he ſaw ſuch and ſuch things already, when as the things which he ſpeaketh that he ſaw, were not accompliſhed at that time, nor many of them not as yet.</p>
               <p>But however they will be accompliſhed, becauſe God is truth, and will not fruſtrate the faith of his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Saints.</p>
               <p>But according to their faith it ſhall be unto them.</p>
               <p>So much concerning the ſeven Lamps and the ſeven Spirits of God, I ſuppoſe the Seed of Faith may underſtand the true meaning of it.</p>

               <p>IN the ſixth verſe <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>And before the Throne there was a Sea of Glaſs like unto Chryſtal, and in the midſt of the Throne, and round about the Throne, were four beaſts full of eyes before and behinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you that have faith, may ſee that there is in Heaven above the ſtars a chryſtal Sea like unto glaſs, or a Sea of glaſs like unto chryſtal, that is, the glorious Water or Sea above the ſtars is ſet forth by thoſe things which are moſt pure, and moſt eſteemed of by the reaſon of man here in the kingdom of this world.</p>
               <p>But as certain as there is a ſea and waters in this world, elſe the creatures therein could not live,</p>
               <p>So likewiſe there is a ſea and waters above the ſtars, though of another nature differing from this here below, yet they are real ſubſtances as theſe are.</p>
               <p>But becauſe mortal men cannot declare, nor make known the nature and ſubſtance of them, neither can mortal man underſtand it, if it could be declared.</p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> calls it a Sea of Glaſs like unto chryſtal, becauſe chryſtal is highly eſteemed of by the reaſon of man.</p>
               <p>But however, it is for certain that there is a Sea and Waters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſtars, let it be like what it will.</p>
               <p>For this I would have the Reader to underſtand, that the things which are, were not made of things which do appear, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> words, then of neceſſity they muſt be made of things that do not appear, that is, of things above the ſtars, from whence the original of all life came.</p>
               <p>But in what condition things were, and are in there in Heaven, no man can tell but by faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the revelation of the ſpirit of Faith will call the waters above the ſtars <hi>A Sea of Glaſs like unto chryſtal,</hi> who ſhall gain-ſay it?</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be looked upon as an Allegory, as many do vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine, but a real ſpiritual ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>For this muſt be underſtood by the Reader, that God created or made all creatures of ſomething: he had matter and ſubſtance to make every creature of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62818:27"/>He did not make living ſubſtances of an Allegory, that is, as if we ſhould ſay God made all things of nothing;</p>
               <p>For an Allegory is nothing, and of nothing comes nothing.</p>
               <p>Yet the vain imagination of wiſe and learned men have not been aſhamed to ſay, that God made this world of nothing: but I ſhal let that paſs.</p>
               <p>Again, what ſhould be the meaning of the <hi>four beaſts full of eyes before and behinde?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe four beaſts which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his Viſion in the midſt of the Throne, and round about the Throne, I declare they were four good beaſts:</p>
               <p>That is, they were four good Kings; and if there were four thouſand good Kings, yet they are all reckoned but into four: all good Kings are included in theſe four.</p>
               <p>Theſe four beaſts do ſignifie the four Monarchies, that is, all the good Kings that acted well, and had faith in the true God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the four Monarchies, are called by the <hi>Revelation of John,</hi> the <hi>four beaſts full of eyes before and behinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what particular perſons theſe four beaſts were, the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of John</hi> gives no light into:</p>
               <p>But this I ſay, that King <hi>David</hi> was one of theſe four beaſts, he being the firſt beaſt that was like a Lyon, he being of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> from whence the Scepter ſhould not depart until <hi>Shiloh</hi> come.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Shiloh</hi> being Chriſt the Root of <hi>David,</hi> he is called <hi>The Lyon of the Tribe of Judah,</hi> as may be read in <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. And <hi>David</hi> being of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and he being choſen King by the Lord Jeſus the Almighty God, as he was the Creator.</p>
               <p>Who afterwards became a Childe, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, and ſo called <hi>The Son of</hi> David <hi>of the Tribe of</hi> Judah.</p>
               <p>When as indeed he was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord: He was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord as he was the Creator:</p>
               <p>But as he took upon him the ſeed of the woman, which is the nature of man, he became a little Childe, and ſo God became fleſh;</p>
               <p>And he being of the Tribe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>age of <hi>David,</hi> as he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, he may be, and is called <hi>The Son of David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whatſoever <hi>David</hi> did in point of war, it was juſtified by Jeſus Chriſt as he was his Lord;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62818:27"/>For it is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>That</hi> David <hi>walked with a perfect heart before the Lord in all things, onely in the matter of</hi> Uriah.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> being the firſt King that wrought righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in all his war, and he being of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> he is called by the <hi>Revelation of John</hi> the firſt beaſt that was like a Lyon;</p>
               <p>For he acted as in the perſon of Chriſt, who is the Lyon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> did propheſie when he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſons.</p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to underſtand, that all theſe four beaſts ſpoken of here, they were men, though they be called by the <hi>Revelation of John,</hi> beaſts.</p>
               <p>Alſo he doth diſtinguiſh them into four ſeveral forms, <hi>the firſt like a Lyon, the ſecond like a Calf, the third beaſt had a face like a man, and the fourth beaſt was like a flying Eagle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe four beaſts, as I ſaid before, were all men, and not onely ſo, but good men; onely this I would have the Reader to minde, that they are called <hi>Beaſts,</hi> in relation to the work that they were to do.</p>
               <p>And ſo they acted after that manner as ſuch beaſts uſe to do.</p>
               <p>As the nature of a Lyon is to deſtroy and tear in pieces.</p>
               <p>And the nature of a Calf is to act ſimply and fooliſhly, and yet innocent alſo.</p>
               <p>Now the third beaſt had a face like a man, that is, he acted as a rational man by wiſdom and policy.</p>
               <p>And the fourth beaſt was like a flying Eagle, that is, he acted in ſwiftneſs and ſtrength, and according to other properties that is in an Eagle.</p>
               <p>And ſo according to the natures and properties of theſe four beaſts did men act, and do act in this world; therefore called <hi>four beaſts,</hi> when as they were no other but men.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall leave the diſtinction of the perſons of the other three to thoſe that are better read in Hiſtories than I am.</p>
               <p>Neither is it revealed unto me who the perſons were; therefore I ſhall ſpeak no more than is revealed unto me: but the Reader may underſtand what the four beaſts are by what is afore-written, therefore I ſhall ſay no more of it, but go unto the 8th verſe.</p>

               <p>IN the eighth verſe it is ſaid, <hi>That the four beaſts had each of them ſix wings about them, and they were full of eyes within, and they reſt not day and night, ſaying, Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and which is, and which is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief things in this verſe to be known, is what is meant by thoſe ſix wings which the four beaſts had, which were full of eyes within.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that each of theſe four beaſts had ſix wings, that is, they had ſix wings apiece.</p>
               <p>And theſe ſix wings apiece, it was the ſpirit of revelation which gave them wiſdom to order and manage the affairs of their battels</p>
               <p>And theſe ſix wings were employed thus:</p>
               <p>Two of them were to be employed before in the fore-front of the battel.</p>
               <p>And two of them were to be employed in the rere, or hinder part of the Army, leſt the enemy ſhould come upon the back of them.</p>
               <p>And the other two wings were to be employed in the middle, that in caſe their enemy ſhould put them to the worſt both before and behinde, that they might flie away with thoſe two wings in the midſt.</p>
               <p>And this was very good revelation and wiſdom, and called by the <hi>Revelation of John, ſix wings;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Scriptures doth call revelation and good counſel, <hi>wings;</hi> As that ſaying, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. verſe 14. it is ſaid, <hi>There was given unto the woman two Wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might flee into the Wilderneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which wings was no other but revelation, as I have opened in the <hi>Interpretation of the Eleventh of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where we finde in the Scriptures that God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Prophets and Apoſtles to flie from one place to another, in caſe of perſecution, it is not meant that God would give them wings to flie.</p>
               <p>But he will give them wiſdom and revelation to get from it.</p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe they may be ſaid to have wings to flie away;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62818:28"/>
and in this ſenſe the four beaſts aforeſaid, may be ſaid to have each of them ſix wings.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>their being full of eyes within,</hi> that is, they had a ſpirit of diſcerning both of ſpiritual and of temporal things;</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>that theſe four beaſts full of eyes before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,</hi> that is, they had the eye of Faith before, and the eye of Reaſon behinde;</p>
               <p>That is, they did diſcern by the eye of Faith before the things of God, and how he became fleſh, and ſhed his blood, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is expreſſed by theſe four beaſts.</p>
               <p>And the eye of Reaſon being behinde, it did diſcern and ſee how the matters went in this world.</p>
               <p>For though it be ſaid they were full of eyes, yet they had but two eyes apiece, that is, the eye of Faith, and the eye of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>But neither of theſe two eyes did offend them, as it doth many thouſands now adays.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Seed of Faith may not ſtumble at this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe I ſay there was but two eyes, when as <hi>John</hi> ſaith <hi>they were full of eyes,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may remember that I have written before concerning the ſeven Spirits of God, and yet but one Spirit.</p>
               <p>Onely that one Spirit had ſeven ſeveral workings in the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe theſe beaſts having but two eyes, yet they were full of diſcerning both of ſpiritual and temporal matters.</p>
               <p>For the eye of Faith did ſee up into heaven, and the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and the eye of Reaſon did ſee the utmoſt parts of this world here below:</p>
               <p>For theſe two eyes did ſee as much as could be ſeen; if they had had forty eyes they could have ſeen no more.</p>
               <p>But in regard they did ſee ſo much, they are ſaid by the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, <hi>that they were full of eyes before and behinde, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again it is ſaid, <hi>That theſe four beaſts reſt not day and night, ſaying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, they ceaſe not to give glory, honor, and thanks to him that ſate on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>I would have the Seed of Faith to obſerve, that theſe four beaſts give glory and honor unto Chriſt here, as he was God the Father.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt verſe of the 5 chapter, <hi>John ſaw in the right hand of him that ſate on the Throne, a Book written within, and on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſealed with ſeven Seals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why doth <hi>John</hi> ſay he ſaw in the right hand of him that ſate upon the Throne a Book written within, and ſealed on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with ſeven Seals, when as he that ſate on the Throne was no other but God the Creator of all things?</p>
               <p>And Jeſus Chriſt is he that created the world, and all things therein, as aforeſaid?</p>
               <p>And yet he that had the Book in his right hand, was not to open the Book, nor to looſe the Seals thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62818:29"/>The meaning is this, that Chriſt Jeſus as he was God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and Creator of all things, it was not his proper place and work to open the Book with ſeven Seals;</p>
               <p>For it doth belong to him, as he is God the Redeemer.</p>
               <p>For, as I ſaid before, God did, and doth act according to the twofold ſtate and condition he was in.</p>
               <p>So that he had the Book of Life in his right hand, as he was God the Creator; but as he is God the Redeemer, he muſt take the Book out of his own right hand, and open it, and looſe the Seals thereof.</p>
               <p>For <hi>John</hi> in his viſion did ſee Chriſt to ſit upon the Throne as he was God the Father, and the Creator.</p>
               <p>Alſo in his viſion he ſaw Chriſt ſit upon the Throne as he was God the Son, and as he ſuffered death, and ſo redeemed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
               <p>And in like manner he and the Elders give thanks and praiſe unto him, as he is the Creator.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes they give thanks unto him all together, as he is the Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Yet all but one God, however it doth ſeem by <hi>Johns</hi> viſion, as if there were two, when as it is ſpoken with relation to a twofold ſtate and condition in God.</p>
               <p>But who can underſtand but the Seed of Faith?</p>
               <p>Therefore I would not have the Seed of Faith to ſtumble at theſe ſayings of <hi>John,</hi> which doth here and there ſpeak as if there were two Gods.</p>
               <p>But conſider, he ſpeaks it but by way of viſion, and all viſions can never be underſtood ſo clear and plain as interpretation is.</p>
               <p>For I am certain that <hi>John</hi> did believe in no other God but one, even Jeſus Chriſt the onely wiſe God, bleſſed for ever and ever, though ſpoken of with relation to a twofold condition, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>This Book which was in Chriſts right hand, as he was God the Father, I declare it was the Book of Life wherein was written the names of all the elect ſeed of all the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and of all the elect ſeed of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, the elect ſeed are all written in that Book of Life which is in Chriſts right hand, and the ſeven ſeals on the backſide of this

book, they were the ſeven viſible Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, they were ſealed up by the doctrine and faith of the Goſpel, they received the holy ſpirit of promiſe, whereby they were ſealed in their ſouls with the holy Spirit of promiſe, that they were redeemed unto eternal happineſs, by the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>And this I ſay, that the witneſs of the ſpirit of Faith, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience here in mortality, it is but a ſealing up to the day of glory.</p>
               <p>Therefore what aſſurance, witneſs, or ſealing ſoever a man hath in his ſoul in this life, it is called by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John, but a ſeal on the back ſide of the book of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For thoſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe, in that they believed the doctrine of Chriſts death and reſurrection, and ſo they were ſealed in their hearts with the aſſurance of eternal life, their names being written within the book of Life,</p>
               <p>And becauſe there was ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> which did truly believe, and were ſealed in their ſouls with the aſſurance of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</p>
               <p>They are called <hi>ſeven Seals on the backſide of the Book of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all ſealing of this ſide of death, it is called but ſealing on the backſide of the Book of Life;</p>
               <p>For it is much like unto a book or letter, the matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is within the letter or book, but the ſeal is without, or on the backſide:</p>
               <p>But he that breaketh open the ſeal of the letter or book, he ſeeth what is within;</p>
               <p>So is it with Chriſt, he having the Book of Life in his right hand, wherein the elect Seed are written, and the aſſurance of faith which the elect Seed of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had, and as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have, are called <hi>the ſeven Seals on the backſide of the Book of Life,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which no man in heaven nor in earth could open the Book, nor looſe the Seals thereof, but Chriſt as he is God and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>You that have faith may ſee what is meant by the Book, and by the ſeven Seals on the backſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>IN the ſecond verſe, <hi>John ſaw a ſtrong Angel proclaming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the Book, and to looſe the ſeals thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the third verſe, <hi>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall paſs by theſe two verſes, there being but little matter of concernment in them, but I ſhall go to the 4 verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I wept much, becauſe no man was found worthy to open, and to read the Book, neither to look thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>John</hi> was at a hard ſet in his viſion, when he ſaw God have a B ok in his right hand,</p>
               <p>And no man in heaven, nor in earth could open it, nor read it.</p>
               <p>There was cauſe enough for <hi>John</hi> to weep, becauſe that Book was the Book of Life,</p>
               <p>And many thouſands and millions of ſouls were written in that Book.</p>
               <p>As he afterwards maketh mention of, and many that had ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſecution unto the death, which were ſlain under the altar, who ſuffered for the teſtimony of Jeſus, whoſe names were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>And if this Book ſhould not have been opened, the condition of the Saints would have been ſad, which ſuffered all thoſe things for the name of Jeſus, who loved not their lives unto death, who had their names recorded in the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>That at the general day of Gods Account, when he ſhall make up his Jewels, their names being written in the Book of Life,</p>
               <p>They may have that bleſſed reward which God did promiſe, and they did faithfully believe, and expect:</p>
               <p>But if none could have opened the book, neither in heaven nor in earth, what benefit would they have had for all their faith and ſufferings?</p>
               <p>This was enough to make <hi>John</hi> and all other Prophets and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to weep alſo, if there ſhould be none found neither in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nor in earth, that can open the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>But in the 5 verſe, one of the Elders ſaid unto <hi>John</hi> in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Weep not, behold the Lion of the tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>the root of</hi> David
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62818:31"/>
                  <hi>hath prevailed to open the Book, and to looſe the ſeven Seals thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the Elders puts <hi>John</hi> in good comfort again; for there is one found now that can open the Book, and read it alſo.</p>
               <p>This is that Lion, as <hi>Jacob</hi> propheſied of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 59. ver. 9, as I have ſpoken of before.</p>
               <p>This Lion hath prevailed to open the book.</p>
               <p>He openeth the Book as he is God the Son,</p>
               <p>And as he became a Son, he is called the <hi>Lion of the tribe of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah; and as he is God the Son, he is called a <hi>Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as he was God the Son, he ſuffered death to redeem his people.</p>
               <p>And as he is a Redeemer, he hath prevailed to open the Book, and to looſe the ſeven Seals thereof.</p>
               <p>That is, as he is the Redeemer, he hath power to raiſe every one of them again that are written in the Book of Life.</p>

               <p>And as he is the Redeemer, he hath power to give life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every one of the Seed of Faith, who were written in the Book of Life.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>John</hi> ſaw there was one found in heaven that could open the book, he gave over weeping.</p>
               <p>For one of the Elders had ſhewed him in the viſion one that could open the Book, and loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the ſeven Seals thereof.</p>
               <p>For in the 6 verſe, John <hi>beheld, and lo in the midſt of the Throne, and of the four beaſts, and in the midſt of the Elders, ſtood a Lamb, as it had been ſlain, having ſeven horns, and ſeven eyes, which are the ſeven ſpirits of God, ſent forth into all the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Lamb which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion in the midſt of the four beaſts and the Elders, it was Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This I ſuppoſe all men that profeſs the Scriptures will confeſs it.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve that this Lamb which ſtood as it had been ſlain, it was no other then God himſelf;</p>
               <p>For this Lamb had ſeven horns and ſeven eyes; now theſe ſeven horns which the Lamb had, it was the faith and patience which the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had, which did inable them to go thorow their ſufferings with cheerfulneſs.</p>
               <p>For when a man doth ſuffer for his Faith in God patiently, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62818:31"/>
willingly, he deſtroyeth his enemy more in ſubmitting unto ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or death it ſelf, than if he ſhould reſiſt his enemy.</p>
               <p>And this doth become a horn to puſh the perſecutors ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> they were by their faith and patience made able to ſuffer perſecution and death it ſelf,</p>
               <p>Which became as ſeven horns to puſh and gall the ſouls of their perſecutors;</p>
               <p>For though the horns of a Lamb doth but little harm to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fleſh, yet when they get within the fleſh they will gall very much.</p>
               <p>That is, when the horn of ſuffering for righteouſneſs gets into the minde and ſoul of the perſecutor, it doth gall his ſoul excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with the fear of eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>This I think experience will ſhew the truth of it;</p>
               <p>For the Quakers and others which ſuffer for a lye, yet they think they ſuffer for truth; and the perſecutors knows no other but that they do ſuffer for truth.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſufferings of the Quakers cannot chuſe but puſh and gall the perſecutors Conſciences;</p>
               <p>The Quakers being ſo ſtedfaſt and confident in their way, which do not fear their lives unto the death.</p>
               <p>This ſuffering of theirs doth trouble and moleſt the mindes of the Civil Powers; which doth ſhew that ſuffering in innocency, though for a lye, it will be a horn to puſh and gall the ſouls of the perſecutors.</p>
               <p>Then how much more would they puſh and gall if they ſuffered for Truth?</p>
               <p>That is, if their Miniſtery which provoke them to meet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Parliaments Order were true, as the Miniſtery of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were.</p>
               <p>But it is not; therefore they ſuffer for a lye, yet the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor not knowing it, he is, and will be puſhed and galled in his ſoul with the fear of eternal death, for doing it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now theſe ſeven horns, as I ſaid before, which the Lamb had, they were the ſufferings of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the ten Perſecutions.</p>
               <p>According to that ſaying of <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> the ſecond and the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, he giving an exhortation to the Church in <hi>Smirna,</hi> that they ſhould fear none of thoſe things which they ſhould ſuffer.</p>

               <p>But as for the ten days tribulation which the Saints ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, it was ſpoken with relation to the ten Perſecutions.</p>
               <p>And they are called by the revelation of the ſpirit but ten days,</p>
               <p>When as it was at times a matter of three hundred years that their tribulation did laſt, which was the ten Perſecutions, yet called by the ſpirit, but <hi>ten days tribulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the faith and patience which theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had, being made able to ſuffer with chearfulneſs thoſe ten days tribulation, it being the ten Perſecutions aforeſaid,</p>
               <p>They are called the ſeven horns which the Lamb had;</p>
               <p>For they by their ſufferings did puſh and gall the ſouls of the perſecutors, as the Lamb himſelf did when he did ſuffer death:</p>
               <p>For he did procure no leſs then eternal damnation to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, by his ſuffering of death,</p>
               <p>And being ſlain by them.</p>
               <p>And theſe ſeven Churches having their power and ſtrength to ſuffer, from Chriſt the Lamb ſlain, they walked in his ſteps in the way of ſuffering;</p>
               <p>Therefore called the <hi>ſeven horns of the Lamb,</hi> or the Lambs ſeven horns.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſeven eyes which the Lamb had, they are called the <hi>ſeven ſpirits of God ſent forth into all the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may remember that I have ſhewed before what the ſeven ſpirit, before the Throne is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62818:32"/>And theſe ſeven ſpirits which the Lamb hath, are the very ſame;</p>
               <p>That is, they are all but one ſpirit of Chriſt, onely this one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth operate and work ſeven ſeveral ways, to wit, in the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore ſaid to be ſent forth into all the earth.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the ſound of theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> of their gifts and ſuffering, went thorow all the earth</p>
               <p>Therefore called the ſeven ſpirits of God; yet I would have the Reader to underſtand thus much,</p>
               <p>That the Lamb that had power to open the book, the ſame Lamb had the ſeven horns and the ſeven eyes.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe ſeven eyes were the ſeven Spirits of God, then the Lamb muſt needs be God:</p>
               <p>For the Lamb had the ſeven Spirits in him, and he ſent them forth unto the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Onely this I would have the Reader to underſtand, that here he is called God, as he is a Lamb ſlain.</p>
               <p>Or as he was in the condition of a Son and a Redeemer.</p>
               <p>So that what power, honor, or glory ſoever be attributed to God, by the redeemed ones,</p>
               <p>It is with relation to the Son-ſhip of God.</p>
               <p>He being a Son he is called <hi>a Lion,</hi> and called <hi>a Lamb,</hi> which titles belongeth onely to the Son-ſhip of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He being the onely God, though in a two fold ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And in the 7 verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that ſate upon the Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he that took the book out of his right hand that ſate upon the Throne,</p>
               <p>It was the Lamb, and this Lamb is Chriſt, and Chriſt is God, and Chriſt is called the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He may well be called the Lamb of God, becauſe he is God.</p>
               <p>For who can take away the ſins of the world, but God?</p>
               <p>But God muſt become a little childe of fleſh, blood and bone, and grow up to a man, that he may be capable to ſuffer the pains of death.</p>
               <p>In that he ſhed his moſt precious blood before he could take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſins of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62818:33"/>And this Lamb which was ſlain here ſpoken of by <hi>John,</hi> was no other but God himſelf.</p>
               <p>But he being now in the condition of a Son, in that he had been ſlain, and was now riſen again, and had accompliſhed the work of Redemption, he was able to ſit down in the midſt of the Throne,</p>
               <p>And to take the book out of his own right hand, as he was the Father and Creator of all things.</p>
               <p>And as he was the Son, or Lamb, which ſhed his precious blood to redeem his people from their ſins, it was his proper work and place to take the book out of his own right hand, as he was the Creator, and to open the book and looſe the ſeven Seals thereof;</p>
               <p>For in his opening the Book of Life, he found the names of all the elect ſeed written therein, which were waſhed and redeemed with his precious blood.</p>

               <p>ANd in the 8 verſe, <hi>The four beaſts, and the four and twenty El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders fell down before the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the 9 verſe, <hi>They ſung a new Song, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and open the Seals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I would have the Reader to mind theſe words, why the four beaſts, and the Elders did ſing a new Song.</p>
               <p>Obſerve it is called, <hi>a new Song,</hi> in oppoſition to the old ſong.</p>
               <p>As the Goſpel of Jeſus is called the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is called the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe there is the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of the Lamb; that is, the ſong of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>Now the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> may be called the <hi>old ſong,</hi> or the <hi>firſt ſong,</hi> becauſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Saints under that Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62818:33"/>I ſay, they gave praiſe, honor, and glory unto Chriſt, as he was God the Father and Creator.</p>
               <p>And as he was the Creator, he bleſſed them with temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and temporal deliverances.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſing praiſe unto God for his wonderful works, which he had wrought by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As you may read in the Scriptures in the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> how wonderfully he doth praiſe, honor, and magnifie the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had gotten himſelf a great and terrible name among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
               <p>And this is called the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the old or firſt ſong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the firſt manifeſtation of God, as he is the Creator;</p>
               <p>For <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt man that gave us to know any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the God of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>And this manifeſtation as <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us, is that we might know God, as he was the Creator, and did deliver his people in a more wonderful manner, then any other heathen gods could do.</p>
               <p>And in this regard <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> gave praiſe, honor, and glory, unto the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He delivering them out of ſo many temporal dangers; and not onely ſo, but bleſſing them with many temporal bleſſings, which cauſed this ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be ſung by the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this regard the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> may be ſaid to be old or the firſt ſong, he being the firſt commiſſionated man to write that which we call the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> may be called <hi>an old Song.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the ſong of the Lamb is more new; for redemption was after creation, therefore called a new Song.</p>
               <p>It is called a <hi>new Song</hi> in relation to a new condition, as the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> was with relation to temporal bleſſings, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But this new Song of the Lamb is with relation to ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>John</hi> in his viſion was ſenſible upon what account this new Song was ſung.</p>
               <p>And he ſeeing in the viſion the four beaſts, and the four and twenty Elders fall down before the Lamb.</p>
               <p>Having every one of them Harps and golden Vials, full of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours which are the prayers of Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62818:34"/>Now theſe golden Vials are meant the hearts and ſouls of the four Beaſts, and four and twenty Elders.</p>
               <p>And the odours, is that grace and ſupplications which was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up unto the Lamb thorow thoſe golden Vials.</p>
               <p>Which Vials are the hearts and ſouls, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And thoſe Harps are the tongues of the Beaſts, and Elders, and Saints, which are as Harps to ſound forth the praiſe of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>For this I muſt tell you, that the tongue of every Saint ſhall be as a Harp, to praiſe the Lamb for his great and unſpeakable work of Redemption, which is more to be magnified by the Seed of Faith, then the work of Creation.</p>
               <p>So that the Beaſts, and the Elders, and Saints may very well ſing that new Song, in the 9 verſe <hi>ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof: for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred &amp; tongue, and people, and nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, thou haſt redeemed us to thy ſelf by thy own blood, for though thou art called a Lamb, thou art no other but God.</p>
               <p>And thy blood is no other but the blood of God, though called the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>Becauſe of that twofold ſtate and condition thou wert in.</p>
               <p>And as the work of Redemption is of greater value to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, than their Creation was, therefore it is that thoſe who are waſhed in the blood of the Lamb, have Harps given them to ſound, or ſing this new Song of Praiſe and Thankſgiving unto him that hath waſhed them in his own blood.</p>
               <p>And the new ſong which the Beaſts, and Elders, and Saints doth ſing, is ſet down in the 12 verſe, <hi>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honor, and glory, and bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo to the end of the Chapter, giving praiſe unto the Lamb for their Redemption.</p>
               <p>And this is that new Song which the Beaſts, and Elders, and Saints, ſhall ſing to eternity.</p>
               <p>It is called a new Song, becauſe it is the Song of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>For there is but two Songs in all, to wit the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Song of the Lamb, and bleſſed and happy are all thoſe that can truly ſing the ſong of the Lamb, to know they are redeemed and waſhed in his blood.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <p>NOw I have given the interpretation of the things that are of moſt concernment in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, I ſhall proceed to open the chief things contained in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>In the firſt verſe of this chapter, <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion the Lamb opening the Seals, and at the Lambs opening of the firſt Seal, <hi>John</hi> heard as it were the noiſe of thunder.</p>
               <p>And in the viſion one of the four Beaſts ſaid unto <hi>John, Come and ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the four Beaſts you may remember I have ſhewed what they are before, and now theſe four Beaſts doth preſent to <hi>Johns</hi> underſtanding, in the viſion four other Beaſts as in a figure to be four Horſes.</p>
               <p>Namely, a white Horſe, a red Horſe, a black Horſe, and a pale Horſe.</p>
               <p>I would have the Reader to minde the interpretation of theſe four Horſes, and their Riders.</p>
               <p>For there is one called, he that ſate on every one of theſe four horſes.</p>
               <p>Alſo there was ſome great and wonderful work done by every one of theſe that ſate on theſe Horſes.</p>
               <p>Therefore called the opening of the Seals.</p>
               <p>And at the opening of the firſt Seal, <hi>John</hi> heard as it were in the viſion the noiſe of thunder, and after that there was preſented unto his view in the viſion, a white horſe.</p>
               <p>And he that ſat on him had a bowe, and a Crown was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</p>
               <p>Now this white Horſe which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion, it is the righteouſneſs of the Saints.</p>
               <p>And the righteouſneſs of Saints, is the righteouſneſs of Faith;</p>
               <p>For it is Paith that makes the ſoul pure and white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>According to that ſaying, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. and 13 and 14 verſes. <hi>One of the Elders anſwered, ſaying unto me, What are theſe which are arayed in white Robes?</hi> and in the 14 verſe, <hi>And he ſaid to me, theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:62818:35"/>So in the 6 chapter and 11 verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>And white robes were given to every one of them,</hi> meaning thoſe which were ſlain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the altar, that is, they were ſlain for the teſtimony of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſaid to be under the altar, becauſe Chriſt is the altar it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Many more places of Scriptures might be named for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to prove that the righteouſneſs of Faith is thoſe white robes which the Saints ſouls are cloathed with.</p>
               <p>Their hearts being purified by faith in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>For faith doth dip its ſoul in his blood, ſo that all original and actal ſin is waſhed away, as clean as if there had never been any ſin at all.</p>
               <p>So that the Saints or Seed of Faith are cloathed with the white robes of righteouſneſs of faith, it being the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He being the author of it by waſhing their ſouls in his own blood.</p>
               <p>So that they become as white as ſnow; and this righteouſneſs of the Saints, is that white Horſe, and the firſt horſe that <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion.</p>
               <p>For I would have the Reader to underſtand, that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith is a real ſpiritual ſubſtance, as the righteouſneſs of the Law is, yet none of them both can be ſeen by the viſible eye of ſenſe,</p>
               <p>Not as they be in their eſſence or ſeed, but by the effects or fruits they are known;</p>
               <p>For effects or fruits doth proceed from an inviſible ſpiritual root or ſubſtance, which roots and ſubſtances is faith and reaſon.</p>
               <p>And there is a righteouſneſs that doth ariſe from each of theſe, which hath their ſeveral effects, or ſeveral fruits;</p>
               <p>So that the tree may be known by the fruit; that is, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law may be known and diſtinguiſhed from the righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
               <p>Yet the life and ſpirit of theſe two trees, are ſo ſecret and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they cannot be ſeen by the eye of ſenſe, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Yet they be two real ſpiritual ſubſtances that doth bring forth a righteouſneſs according to their natures.</p>
               <p>That is, the righteouſneſs of the Law, and the righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
               <p>But it is thoſe ſouls that are cloathed with the white Robe of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62818:35"/>
Chriſts righteouſneſs of faith, that have been waſhed in his blood, and this is that white horſe <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of.</p>
               <p>For this I would have the Seed of Faith to minde, that the ſpirit of <hi>Revelation</hi> in <hi>John,</hi> doth compare the righteouſneſs of the Saints to a white horſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo this I would, have you to minde, though the Saints that are cloathed in white, be thouſands, and millions, and innumerable,</p>
               <p>Yet they are called by the revelation of the ſpirit, but one white horſe.</p>
               <p>Now whether <hi>John</hi> did ſee in the viſion the form of a white horſe, it is not much material for it the ſpirit; will call the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Saints, a white horſe, who ſhall gainſay it?</p>
               <p>But however the white Robes of the Saints, who are waſhed in the blood of the Lamb, are as a white horſe for God their King to ride upon.</p>
               <p>So that if you underſtand the interpretation of this white horſe, you may the more eaſily know the meaning of the other three horſes.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is neceſſary to know who doth ride or ſit upon this white horſe; I declare by Revelation from the holy Spirit, that he which <hi>John</hi> ſaw ſit on the white horſe, it was no other but Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>It was he that had a bowe, and a crown was given unto him, it may be ſaid the crown was given unto him, as he was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>For this crown of Glory that was given unto him, it was as he was the Redeemer, and not as he was the Creator.</p>
               <p>And as he was the Redeemer, he ſate or rode upon the white horſe.</p>
               <p>And he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</p>
               <p>That is, he being the author of the righteouſneſs of Faith, as he was the Redeemer, that he made the Saints ſo pure and white, that they became a white horſe for him to ſit upon.</p>
               <p>So that they were able by their faith, in the blood of the Lamb to ſuffer tribulation, and death it ſelf,</p>
               <p>So that they became more then conquerors; for he that ſuffereth perſecution for the name of Jeſus, he doth conquer more then he that doth perſecute and put to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62818:36"/>So likewiſe Chriſt that ſate upon this white horſe, as he was the Redeemer, he went forth conquering and to conquer.</p>
               <p>That is, he went forth in the power of faith, by which he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things; he went forth to redeem the Seed of <hi>Adam</hi> that was fallen under death, and the fear of eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>So that death and hell got power over <hi>Adam</hi> and his Seed, ſo that Chriſt riding upon the white Horſe of innocency, or the righteouſneſs of Faith, he went forth conquering and to conquer.</p>
               <p>That is, he went forth to die, to ſhed his moſt precious blood, and by his giving himſelf up unto death.</p>
               <p>He conquered over ſin, death, and hell.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>Oh death! I will be thy death, oh grave I will be thy victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, he will get victory over the grave, as he did over death; for he deſtroyed death, in that death could not keep him under it for ever, in that he paſſed thorow it.</p>
               <p>He got victory over the grave, in that the grave could not keep him incloſed in the earth.</p>
               <p>So that he went forth conquering and to conquer, never leaving off until he had conquered all his enemies.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, ſin, death, devil, hell, the grave; theſe all were his enemies, and he hath conquered over them all, by his beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fleſh, and by his ſuffering of death upon the Croſs, as he was a Redeemer, or as he was God the Son, and theſe enemie, did Chriſt which ſate upon the white horſe, go forth conquering and to conquer, to redeem the Seed of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the true meaning what is meant by the white horſe, and by him that ſate thereon, and by his conquering and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
               <p>And the bowe which he had, it ſignified the power he had to ſhout and kill thoſe ſpiritual enemies, which is ſin, death, hell, and devil.</p>
               <p>Which could no ways have been killed, but by giving his life up unto death, and by his paſſing thorow death, and quickening into life again, he killed death, ſin, hell, and the devil,</p>
               <p>With this dart of offering up his ſoul unto death, it being ſhot thorow ſin, death, and hell, by the ſtrength, or bowe of the power of faith in God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:62818:36"/>And as for the Crown that was given him, it is ſpoken with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Son-ſhip of God, as he is a Redeemer.</p>
               <p>So that the Crown of Glory that he hath given him, it is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto him, as he is a Redeemer.</p>
               <p>For the work of Redemption is counted by the redeemed ones, more worthy of a Crown of glory, then the work of creation.</p>
               <p>So that this Crown of glory that is given to Chriſt that ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the white Horſe, it is in relation to his work of Redemption, in that he conquered over all thoſe ſpiritual enemies as aforeſaid. So much for the firſt and ſecond verſes.</p>

               <p>IN the 3 verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And when he had opened the ſecond Seal, I heard the ſecond Beaſt ſay, Come and ſee.</hi> And in the 4 verſe, <hi>There went out another horſe, that was red, and power was given to him that ſate thereon, to take peace from the earth, and that they ſhould kill one another: and there was given unto him a great Sword.</hi>

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:62818:37"/>Now this great Sword it was to kill, and in killing one another, peace muſt needs be taken from the earth.</p>
               <p>So that this Kingly Power, though they were many Kings, yet they are called but <hi>him that ſate upon the red horſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe, though there were many thouſand ſlain, and had their blood ſhed, yet they are all called but <hi>A red horſe;</hi> ſo that there is but the horſe and his rider: for Kings and Magiſtrates do ride upon the people, in that they command the people to kill one another.</p>
               <p>So that people which go to fight to ſhed one anothers blood, may well be called <hi>A red horſe,</hi> for they make their ſouls as red as ſcarlet with blood-ſhed.</p>
               <p>And the power of the Magiſtrate doth ride and ſit upon this red horſe, for he hath a great ſword given unto him to command perſecutors to kill one another, and they muſt obey and become a red horſe, or elſe they muſt be killed themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus in ſhort I have given you the ſignification of the <hi>red horſe,</hi> and of him that ſits thereon.</p>
               <p>For the Sword, Famine, or Peſtilence, doth always take peace from the earth: and he that ſate upon this red horſe was ſuch a Power or Government, that did kill many men with the ſword.</p>
               <p>And it is called <hi>A great Sword,</hi> in regard it ſhould prevail and do much execution in that kinde, therefore ſaid to go forth upon a red horſe.</p>
               <p>To ſignifie that he ſhould ride upon bloody-minded men that ſhould ſpare neither man, woman, or childe, therefore called <hi>A red horſe.</hi>

               <p>ANd in the fifth verſe, <hi>And when he had opened the third Seal,</hi> John <hi>heard the third Beaſt ſay, Come and ſee: and he beheld; and a lo black Horſe, and he that ſate on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This black horſe which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion, it was the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bindneſs and darkneſs upon the mindes of men, which makes them to worſhip falſe gods, or idols; they being not ſo much as enlightned in the Law of Reaſon,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62818:37"/>That is, their mindes and underſtandings had the moſt ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and loweſt degree of reaſon, which made them to become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream idolatrous; their mindes being ſo dark, they fall to worſhip any thing in ſtead of God.</p>
               <p>Even the Sun, Moon, Stars and Planets: Now theſe people that do this, are exceeding dark in their mindes.</p>
               <p>But let us come to thoſe that are more enlightned, as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thoſe we call <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> being educated under the diſcipline of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are called <hi>The Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet men being in their ſtate of nature, they are very dark in their minds concerning the knowledge of the true God, and the true ſpiritual Worſhip which God requires;</p>
               <p>For the not knowing of God, is the cauſe of all falſe worſhip, which darkneſs hath, and doth lye almoſt upon the whole Creation.</p>
               <p>For was not that a great darkneſs upon the minds of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that would worſhip a Calf for a God?</p>
               <p>And hath not the ſame darkneſs deſcended upon the mindes of them that profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, beſides that pitchy and black darkneſs that lieth upon the heathen?</p>
               <p>Is not the Pope and Romane Catholicks full of ſuperſtition and idolatry, becauſe they know not the true God? Hath not the <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> ſome ſuperſtition and idolatry in it, though not ſo much as the Romane Catholickes? So the <hi>Preſbyter</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Baptiſt, Ranter,</hi> and <hi>Quaker,</hi> they be all ſuperſtitious and idolatrous in their wroſhip.</p>
               <p>Nay, the <hi>Quaker</hi> that ſeemeth to have the leaſt idolatry in their worſhip of any, yet they are idolatrous alſo.</p>
               <p>For they meet, preach, and pray to an unknown God, as well as the others afore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>For they have no other God but the light of Chriſt, as they call it, and this light of theirs ſeemeth to be the greateſt and pureſt ſpiritual light of all, but it is the greateſt ſpiritual darkneſs of all.</p>
               <p>For they are more willfully ignorant of the true God, then any of the reſt afore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>So that ſpiritual darkneſs hath overſpread the minds of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion, as it hath done the Heathen;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62818:38"/>For none of them knows the true God, nor the true ſpiritual Worſhip which God requireth, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>So that this ſpirituall blindneſs and darkneſs that lieth upon the generality of mens minds, their not knowing the true God, nor his true worſhip, is that black horſe which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion.</p>
               <p>Alſo he that ſat upon this black horſe had a pair of balances in his hand.</p>
               <p>He that ſat on this black horſe was an ignorant power, King or Kings, or Magiſtrates power that was extream ignorant of any true ſpiritual knowledge either of God, or of his Worſhip:</p>
               <p>But mighty full of ſuperſtition and idolatry, but had great power to command the dark-minded people to worſhip what he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>So that he rode, or ſat upon their dark minds as upon a black horſe;</p>
               <p>For he had ſuch power that he brought them all into a unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of worſhip.</p>
               <p>So that things were mighty plentiful, as you may read verſe, 6. <hi>A meaſure of wheat for a penny, and three meaſures of barley for a penny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Onely to ſignifie the plenty of earthly things, when ignorance being in power, it rides or fits upon the black horſe of idolatry.</p>
               <p>This I think by experience will prove the truth of it as well as Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Was not that a plentiful time when they baked Cakes to the Queen of heaven?</p>
               <p>Was there not great plenty when the Roman Catholick did put Chriſt into worſhip? When they had brought all people to a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of religion, all things were plenty.</p>
               <p>Then men grew exceeding rich, ſo that particular men had ſuch vaſte eſtates, that they could build a Church at their own charge, or an Hoſpital, or Almſ-houſes, ſo there was great plenty, their being but one religion, and a uniform government in matter of worſhip:</p>
               <p>All peoples minds being dark as to any true ſpiritual knowledge,</p>
               <p>So that they became as a black horſe for thoſe ignorant Popiſh Kings to ride or fit upon: and he that ſate upon the black horſe, had a pair of ballances in his hand.</p>
               <p>Onely to ſignifie that equal dealing in temporal matters, ſeeing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62818:38"/>
there was a uniformity in worſhip, there ſhould be an equal and juſt dealing in the temporal,</p>
               <p>And for that purpoſe there was a pair of ballances in the hand of him that ſate upon the black horſe.</p>
               <p>For ignorant reaſon doth many times deal more juſtly, then that reaſon that is more ſubtile and cunning doth.</p>
               <p>For in former times, when there was no religion durſt appear but the Papiſt religion and worſhip, which was, and is ſtill exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of ſuperſtition and idolatry,</p>
               <p>There was a great deal more juſt dealing between man and man in temporal things,</p>
               <p>And men were more freer to truſt one another then they are now.</p>
               <p>So that things were exceeding plentiful, and cheap; for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uniformity in idolatry muſt needs cauſe love one to another.</p>
               <p>For differing in worſhip maketh the greateſt breach of all, even between the neereſt relations, as Father, and Son, Mother, and Daughter, they will all part upon the point of worſhip, ſooner then upon any natural offence whatſoever.</p>
               <p>This may be proved by Chriſts words, <hi>that a man muſt f rſake Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mother, Houſe, and Lands, for his ſake, elſe he is not worthy of him:</hi> This alſo experience will prove it, that ſome people will willingly ſuffer more for their worſhip, though it be a lie, then for any natural loſe whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And as for the oyl, and the wine, which he that ſate upon the black horſe, muſt not hurt; the oyl, and the wine ſignifies that little ſmall remnant of the Seed of Faith, which did not worſhip God in that idolatry no way as the generality of people did, their appearance being ſo ſmall, that they were not worth the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or compelling to worſhip as the generality of people did, much like unto thoſe ſeven thouſand that did not bowe their knee to <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe ſeven thouſand were never miſt by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor by the Prophet <hi>Elijah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the worſhippers of <hi>Baal</hi> were ſo numerous, that <hi>Elijah</hi> thought there was none but himſelf that did worſhip the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there was ſeven thouſand that had not bowed their knee to <hi>Baal.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62818:39"/>And theſe were the oyl, and the wine that ſhould not be hurt, by compelling of them, to hurt their conſciences by worſhipping a falſe God, as the generality of the people did, thorow the darkneſs of their mindes.</p>
               <p>They being the black horſe, for the ignorant dark power of the Head-Magiſtrate to ride or ſit upon.</p>
               <p>For as the horſe is black, ſo is the rider with ignorance and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſpiritual worſhip.</p>
               <p>Onely he that ſits upon the black horſe, is the dark power of reaſon;</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apoſtles calls it the power of darkneſs, for it is the dark reaſon of man that doth act deeds of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Therefore called the power of darkneſs: and the deeds of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual darkneſs in point of worſhip, is called by the <hi>Revelation of John,</hi> he that ſits upon the black horſe.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he commandeth all people to worſhip his imaginary God,</p>
               <p>And the people thorow the darkneſs of their underſtandings, they do obey, and ſo they become in point of ſpiritual worſhip, a black horſe.</p>

               <p>ANd in the 7 verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And when he had opened the fourth Seal, I heard the fourth beaſt ſay, Come and ſee:</hi> and in the 8 verſe, John <hi>looked, and behold a pale horſe, and his name that ſate on him was Death, and hell followed with him: and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with ſword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beaſts of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have the Reader to minde the interpretation of this pale horſe, becauſe everyone of us muſt be a pale horſe for death to ſit upon.</p>
               <p>Except we be ſwallowed up of life, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> was;</p>
               <p>Which I, nor no man elſe at this day doth know he ſhall.</p>
               <p>So that death muſt ride upon all ſinful fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now to give you the meaning what this pale horſe is, it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the ſinful ſoul of man and woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62818:39"/>Therefore as the Scriptures ſaith, <hi>When ſin entred into the world, then death entred in upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that as ſoon as ever the ſouls of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had let ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Then death entered; for death did ride upon ſin, and ſin did ride upon the ſoul of ours firſt parents,</p>
               <p>According to that ſaying of God, <hi>in the day that thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> meaning the forbidden fruit, <hi>thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that as ſoon as ſin entred into their ſouls, death entred alſo.</p>
               <p>So that the ſouls of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> became as a pale horſe, for death to ride upon.</p>
               <p>For there was not onely the fear of this firſt death, but the fear of eternal death alſo,</p>
               <p>Which made the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> to fear, therefore he went to hide himſelf.</p>
               <p>For the fear of death will make the ſoul to look pale, ſo that it will become a pale horſe for death to ride upon.</p>
               <p>For by ſin entering into the world, death got power over all life;</p>
               <p>So that death ſits upon all life, both upon man and beaſts.</p>
               <p>For the beaſts are made ſubject to death, by reaſon of the fall of man;</p>
               <p>Onely I would have the Reader to underſtand this ſecret, that the creatures, the beaſts, were created of God, on purpoſe to be killed for the nouriſhment of man.</p>
               <p>But if ſin had never been committed by man, death would never have entered upon the life of man nor beaſt.</p>
               <p>That is, no beaſt would have died naturally, as they do now.</p>
               <p>But what were killed on purpoſe for ſome uſe, ſo that no man would have had ſuch loſe as ſome men now have.</p>
               <p>Some are undone by the dying of Horſes, others by Cows, and others by Sheep, and this is death that hath entered into the world upon the beaſts.</p>
               <p>For the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> brought death upon all his poſterity, and upon the beaſts alſo, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>So that the life of man and beaſts is become a pale horſe for death to ſit upon,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62818:40"/>And the fear of death in <hi>Adam,</hi> did make his ſoul to look pale,</p>
               <p>And ſo it doth in all mankinde, the fear of death it makes the ſtouteſt heart to look pale; eſpecially when the fear of eternal death is not taken away.</p>
               <p>As very few men in the world have the fear of the ſecond death taken from them.</p>
               <p>So that their ſouls look pale indeed; ſo that the generality of men and women have the fear of eternal death, that ſits upon their ſouls, ſo that they are that pale horſe that death rideth upon.</p>
               <p>And hell follows immediately after the firſt death: the ſecond death and hell go both together hand in hand.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I ſay, will make any ſoul to look pale.</p>
               <p>This I can experience both by my ſelf and others, before I came to know the true way of redemption.</p>
               <p>And becauſe you the Seed of Faith may know, that the ſoul of man is that pale horſe that death ſits upon,</p>
               <p>Which ſin did cauſe to enter upon all life.</p>
               <p>I ſay, this death it entered upon the life of God himſelf;</p>
               <p>So that God died unto ſin, that is to ſatisfie ſin, that ſin which brought death with it might enter upon the life of God, and kill that life in God for a moment.</p>
               <p>But the life of God being more ſtrong then death, it pierced thorow the body of death, and quickened a new life again.</p>
               <p>So that he overcame death, in that death could not keep him under it,</p>
               <p>As it doth the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and his poſterity.</p>
               <p>It is much like unto a valiant ſoldier, who by his valor and ſtrength, paſſeth thorow a body of men well armed.</p>
               <p>And by his getting thorow that body of men, he comes to rout and ſcatter them, and gets the victory over them.</p>
               <p>So was it with Chriſt the onely God, he laying down his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head life, it being in the Manhood unto death, he paſſed thorow death, and killed that which did kill him, to wit, ſin, death, and hell.</p>
               <p>Theſe being mighty ſtrong enemies, too ſtrong for any created ſoul or life to encounter with.</p>
               <p>None could do it but the life of the eternal God himſelf;</p>
               <p>For ſin lyeth heavy upon the ſoul of man, and death is the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62818:40"/>
king of fears, it maketh kings to fear and tremble at the ſight of it.</p>
               <p>And hell is worſe then death it ſelf; yet theſe ſtrong enemies are overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and in all thoſe that have faith in it, and doth truly underſtand it.</p>
               <p>So that you that have faith may ſee, what this pale horſe is <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of, and what death is that ſits upon the pale horſe.</p>
               <p>And what power they have given unto them, over the four parts of the earth.</p>
               <p>Even to kill with the Sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beaſts of the earth.</p>
               <p>The pale horſe and death hath power given them over all life, in the four parts of the earth.</p>
               <p>So that ſome being ſo affrighted at death, they ſhall kill with the ſword.</p>
               <p>And others again ſhall be ſo fearful of death, that they ſhall ſtarve themſelves for hunger.</p>
               <p>Others again ſhall come under death by natural diſeaſes, even as the beaſts of the earth dieth.</p>
               <p>So that death that rideth upon the pale horſe, hath power given as long as this world doth laſt, over all fleſh that hath life.</p>
               <p>For it is life that muſt die, and death muſt take it into his cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſwallow up life into the belly of death.</p>
               <p>Elſe he cannot be called death, except death doth utterly anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate life, it cannot properly be called death.</p>
               <p>For while life is in being, death is utterly annihilated in life.</p>
               <p>So that there is no being for death at all not in that mans body.</p>
               <p>But when death entreth into that mans blood, who was ſo full of life before,</p>
               <p>Then death groweth more and more in the blood, and eateth up the life quite into death.</p>
               <p>So that there is nothing to be ſeen in all that life, but a dead body.</p>
               <p>For death hath got the life of that body in the body, for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was life before, as well as the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But death having overcome them both, they are both ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of death.</p>
               <p>So that you may ſee death as he is;</p>
               <p>As you did ſee life as he was before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62818:41"/>And not that the life goes out of the body, as men do vainly imagine, ſo that death is he that rideth upon the pale horſe, as I ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And theſe four horſes as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of in his viſion, are the ſame horſes as <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaketh of in his viſion, <hi>Zechariah</hi> the 6 and the 3 verſe, the Prophet ſaw in his viſion, four Charrets, and Horſes, <hi>the firſt Charret had red horſes, and the ſecond had black horſes, and the third had white horſes, and the fourth had grizled and bay horſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Prophet expreſſeth in his viſion the horſes in the plural number, to be more horſes then one of a ſort.</p>
               <p>But <hi>John</hi> declares them in his viſion in the ſingular number.</p>
               <p>Therefore though there be more expreſt by the Prophet, yet the matter and ſubſtance is all one;</p>
               <p>For all horſes are comprized under thoſe four.</p>
               <p>So that there needeth no further opening of the horſes, then there hath been.</p>
               <p>For there is enough ſaid concerning thoſe four horſes, and their riders, to ſatisfie the Seed of Faith.</p>
               <p>But if one ſhould ſpeak never ſo much, the ſeed of reaſon will not be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Onely this I would have the Reader not to ſcruple, becauſe the Prophet calls the fourth horſe grizled and bay, when as <hi>John</hi> calls it a pale horſe.</p>
               <p>For grizled doth ſignifie death ſitting upon the life, as paleneſs doth.</p>
               <p>So that the thing is all one, though differing ſomething in words.</p>
               <p>So that there needeth be no further interpretation upon thoſe four horſes, therefore I ſhall paſs by them, and come to the next thing of concernment.</p>

               <p>IN the 9 verſe of this chapter, <hi>At the opening of the fifth ſeal,</hi> John <hi>ſaw in the viſion the ſouls of them that were ſlain under the altar for the word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to conſider, that viſions doth many times preſent to him that ſeeth it,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62818:41"/>Things that are at a diſtance and far off, as at preſent, or neer at hand.</p>
               <p>As if the thing were in preſent being;</p>
               <p>This hath been the uſual cuſtom of thoſe that write thoſe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>They being preſented to the choſen Prophets and Meſſengers of the moſt high God,</p>
               <p>Thoſe viſions ſo preſented, were to ſignifie either ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary happineſs and deliverances to a particular perſon, or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or nation; or elſe ſome great judgement, and deſtruction to a perſon, people, or nation, in the temporal, as aforeſaid;</p>
               <p>Or elſe viſions are preſented to the underſtanding of man, to ſignifie ſpiritual and eternal bleſſings,</p>
               <p>To a number of people, or elſe to ſignifie ſpiritual and eternal miſeries unto a number of people.</p>
               <p>So that what viſions be declared by choſen men of God, though the thing be not immediately at hand, whether the viſion doth ſignifie temporal or ſpiritual things,</p>
               <p>Yet the Seed of Faith doth look upon it, as if it were in preſent being.</p>
               <p>Becauſe they believe the truth of the thing; as thoſe Prophets of old did propheſie of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in the 9 chapter, <hi>To us a Childe is born, and to us a Son is given,</hi> meaning Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Prophet ſaith, he is born, when as he was not bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> many hundred years after that;</p>
               <p>And ſo other of the Prophets looked upon the birth of Chriſt the Redeemer, as in preſent being.</p>
               <p>For, as I have ſaid in my other Writings, that faith doth look at things afar off, and at a diſtance, as neer at hand, and in preſent being.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the ſeed of reaſon cannot do ſo, therefore they do not prevent neither the temporal nor the eternal judgement that will come upon them.</p>
               <p>But you the Seed of Faith may know, that <hi>John</hi> did ſee in the viſion by the eye of Faith, the ſouls of them that were ſlain under the altar,</p>
               <p>And he heard the cry of them, when the fifth Seal was opened,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:62818:42"/>That God their Redeemer would avenge their blood on them, hat dwell on the earth.</p>
               <p>That is, upon the perſecutors that dwell on the earth.</p>
               <p>Now I would have you the Seed of Faith to underſtand, how theſe that were ſlain under the altar could cry for vengeance, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were dead under the altar, and yet is ſaid, to cry aloud for vengeance, on them that perſecuted and put them to death.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that the blood of thoſe that were ſlain for the teſtimony of Jeſus, it did cry vertually and efficaciouſly unto God, that he would avenge it according to his will and promiſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo God doth hear the cry of their blood, that was ſlain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the altar.</p>
               <p>I ſay, God doth hear their cry, as he did the cry of the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> it came up unto God, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and 10. <hi>And God ſaid unto</hi> Cain, <hi>What haſt thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood cryeth unto me from the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did cry from the ground, unto the Lord for vengeance: and who muſt the righteous Judge be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of, but he that ſhed his brothers blood?</p>
               <p>And in this manner did the ſouls of them that were ſlain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the altar for the word of God, and the teſtimony they held, cry for vengeance upon thoſe that perſecuted, and put them to death.</p>
               <p>So that you the ſeed of reaſon may ſee, that there is power in blood that is ſhed for conſcience ſake in point of worſhip, to cry unto the Lord for vengeance upon thoſe that do murder, and kill upon that account.</p>
               <p>And no perſecutor of that nature will eſcape vengeance to come, no more then <hi>Cain</hi> did eſcape that ſlew his brother.</p>
               <p>For the blood of thoſe that are ſlain in ſuch a caſe, as aforeſaid, will ſpeak no better things then the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the very ſame thing will cry aloud for vengeance, as the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> and as their blood did that was ſlain under the altar, as <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore the blood of Chriſt is ſaid to ſpeak better things then the blood of <hi>Abel:</hi> But this I muſt tell you, it ſpeaketh better things to thoſe that have faith in his death, and ſo are waſhed by faith in his blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62818:42"/>To thoſe it ſpeaketh peace, joy, life, and ſalvation to the ſoul, and theſe are better things then the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> or the blood of the Saints, which ſpeaketh to the ſoul, fear, horror, death, and eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>Theſe be the things that the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> and all innocent blood doth ſpeak, and the blood of Chriſt will ſpeak the ſame things, as <hi>Abels</hi> blood doth, to thoſe that perſecuted and put him to death at that time.</p>
               <p>So that according to the ſerpents deſire, his blood will be upon them and their children; for the ſerpents children are thoſe that walk in the ſteps of their fathers, and as they that put him to death, were the ſeed of <hi>Cain</hi> their father, as Chriſt ſaid.</p>
               <p>To thoſe Jews that ſought his life, he ſaid unto them, <hi>You are of your father the devil, and his works you do; for he was a murderer, and a liar from the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And who was he that did the firſt murder? was it not <hi>Cain?</hi> and they were his children, and all perſecuting men ſince have been their children.</p>
               <p>And in perſecuting the innocent Saints, they juſtifie the deeds of their fathers that perſecuted Chriſt, and their perſecuting of Chriſt, in ſo doing they juſtified the deeds of the devil their father, that ſlew the Prophets, and <hi>Cain</hi> that ſlew <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The grandfather of all perſecuting devils, for worſhipping of God contrary to the tradition of their fathers.</p>
               <p>So that the blood of righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> the blood of Chriſt, and the blood of the Saints, will be upon the conſciences of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſeed of the ſerpent, and upon their children, who walk in the ſteps of their grandfather <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this hath, and will be fulfilled upon all the children of thoſe perſecuting Jews, which put Chriſt to death.</p>
               <p>So that his blood will be upon them and their children; for theſe are their children, and may be called ſo who are the ſeed of the ſerpent, who walk in the way of their fathers, who did kill the Lord of Life.</p>
               <p>And ſo his blood will be upon them and their children, as they did deſire.</p>
               <p>So that his blood doth cry, as the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did, for eternal vengeance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:62818:43"/>For none will ſhed blood upon that account, but the ſerpent or devil, and thoſe that are his children.</p>
               <p>So that you whoſe underſtandings are enlightned, may ſee that there is a vertue and power in the blood of Prophets, Apoſtles, and righteous men which are Saints, who ſuffer for the true decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>To cry unto the Lord for vengeance, upon thoſe that ſhed their blood,</p>
               <p>And the Lord will hear the cry of blood, more then he will the cry of the Saint before his blood was ſhed.</p>
               <p>For the very deed of murther for Religion ſake, hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of vengeance in it.</p>
               <p>So that God the rightous Judge muſt needs do right to reward every one according to his works;</p>
               <p>So that the ſuffering of perſecution and death for Truths ſake, as theſe Saints did, as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of, ſhall have a bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as is ſaid in the 11 verſe, <hi>Thoſe that were ſlain under the altar for the word of God, and the teſtimony they held, they had white robes given unto every one of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was ſaid to them, <hi>Reſt yet for a little ſeaſon, until their fellow ſervants alſo and their brethren that ſhould be killed as they were, ſhould be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you the Seed of Faith may know that theſe ſouls that were ſlain under the altar, were not yet in heaven, neither is thoſe white robes yet put upon them, notwithſtanding it is ſaid, <hi>there were white robes given them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſurely if thoſe ſouls had been in the heaven of glory with their white robes of the rightouſneſs of faith upon them, God would never have bid them reſt a little ſeaſon untill their fellow ſervants, and brethren were killed, as they were.</p>
               <p>So that it may be clear to you that have faith in the death of the ſoul, and of a reſurrection that there is no ſouls go to heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bodies.</p>
               <p>So that ſouls cannot go to heaven, and put on white robes to ſtand in the preſence of God without bodies,</p>
               <p>So that theſe ſouls which cried for vengeance muſtly ſtill in the earth and reſt a ſeaſon, untill the reſt of the Seed of Faith hath paſſed from death as you have.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:62818:43"/>So that God may raiſe you all together, and cloth you all with white robes of rightouſneſs and immortality, and glory, at the reſurrection at the end of the world.</p>
               <p>So that you may all be rewarded and clothed with white robes together, and not ſome ſerved this year, and other ſome the next, but you ſhall all be happy together.</p>
               <p>So that you muſt reſt yet a little ſeaſon, untill all things is accompliſhed, and then I will bleſs you with an everlaſting crown of life,</p>
               <p>Becauſe you ſuffered death for my name, in witneſſing to me, and I will avenge your blood upon mine and your enemies, that perſecuted and put me and you to death.</p>
               <p>They ſhall have their reward alſo; which reward of their deeds will amount to no leſs than to eternal damnation, where the black and dark fire of hell ſhall burn in their ſouls to eternity.</p>
               <p>Which ſhall cauſe them to cry, Oh the eternity, the eternity, with ſorrow, pain and ſhame: And when you Saints ſhall receive your eternal joys, then ſhall your enemies receive their eternal ſorrows.</p>
               <p>Which is not yet, neither will it be until all things be fulfilled which the Scriptures hath foretold of, which cannot be long, as men do vainly imagine.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the true Witneſs of the Spirit is now extant in the world, who hath declared and made manifeſt the myſtery of the true God becoming fleſh, and what the right Devil is, with many other heavenly myſteries.</p>
               <p>So that you that have faith in this Commiſſion of the Spirit, ſhall at the end of the world receive, with the reſt of the Saints, white robes with them, and you will not think it long; for Faith doth look upon eternity as real, as if it were in preſent being.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>John</hi> might ſay by h s revelation in his viſion, <hi>that he ſaw under the Altar the ſouls of them that were ſlain for the word of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the white robes that were given unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe he by faith knew that God will give thoſe that are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the white robes of the righteouſneſs of Faith, a Crown of everlaſting joy and glory, at the end of the world, which is as ſure as if it were in preſent being.</p>
               <p>Therefore by faith he may ſay he ſaw the Saints that ſuffered
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62818:44"/>
for the teſtimony of Jeſus, to have white robes given them, as if the thing were already done; for when things are certain to be done, and nothing can prevent it, a man may ſay it is done.</p>
               <p>So it is with Faith, it knowing that nothing can prevent Gods deſign and purpoſe, in that he hath determined to ſave and bleſs thoſe the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> and to deſtroy and curſe thoſe the ſeed of the Serpent, to eternity.</p>
               <p>So that eternity is looked upon by the Seed of Faith to be in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being. And this was <hi>Johns</hi> revelation in the viſion which he ſaw in the opening of the fifth Seal.</p>

               <p>NOw in the twelfth verſe, <hi>John</hi> ſaw when he opened the ſixth Seal, <hi>He beheld, and lo there was a great Earthquake, and the Sun became black as Sackcloth of hair, and the Moon became as blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have opened the meaning of the Earthquake, and of the Sun being as black as ſackcloth of hair, and the Moon like blood: theſe things I have opened already in <hi>The Interpretation of the Eleventh Chapter of the Revelation,</hi> ſo that I ſhall ſay no more of it here.</p>
               <p>And as for the latter part of this Chapter, it is onely a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Onely this, I ſhall give you a word or two, to ſhew what is meant by the Heavens being departed as a ſcroll when it is rolled together, as it is ſaid verſe 14. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 34.4.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that the Clouds of Heaven, and the Air, and the influence of the Stars of Heaven, ſhall be rolled up as a Scroll;</p>
               <p>For the Clouds and Air have ſpread themſelves over the face of the Skie, ſo they may be called the Heavens; for were it not for the Clouds to ſcatter the Rain on the earth, and the Air to blow upon the creatures here on earth, all creatures would die.</p>
               <p>So that man and beaſts, and all creatures do poſſeſs a Heaven in themſelves, even from the influence of the Clouds and the Air.</p>
               <p>So that the Clouds and the Air is that Heaven that God will at the end of the world roll up like a Scroll.</p>
               <p>Alſo God will take away the Sun, Moon, and Stars, ſo that they ſhall not penetrate their light and heat thorow the Air and Clouds
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62818:44"/>
of Heaven, not to give any refreſhment to the ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, who ſhall be left here in this earth in utter darkneſs.</p>
               <p>For this earth ſhall be the place of hell for the reprobate ſeed to be in to eternity; ſo that they ſhall cry unto the Mountaines and Rocks to fall upon them, to hide them from the wrath of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>That is, they could wiſh that the Mountains and Rocks would cruſh them to pieces, ſo that they might be hid as to have no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all;</p>
               <p>Seeing the Clouds and the Air which over-ſpread the Heaven which did refreſh our lives, which made our lives to live in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alſo.</p>
               <p>But now this is rolled up like a ſcroll, there is nothing but black darkneſs, without Air or Winde, which makes us burn like fire and brimſtone, we having no refreſhings from the Heavens, ſo that it would be happy for us if the Mountains and Rocks would fall upon us, that we might be hid, or have no ſenſible being for ever.</p>
               <p>And this will be the ſtate of the reprobate ſeed at the end of the world: And this is the true meaning of the Heaven being rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up like a ſcroll, and not the fixed Element;</p>
               <p>For the fixed Element hath an earth ſtanding upon it, which ſhall ſtand to eternity.</p>
               <p>Onely this, the Sun, Moon, and Stars that gave light on this ſide the Skie, ſhall be taken from the Heaven, ſo that nothing but darkneſs ſhall remain for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>But the Element which we call <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſhall ſtand to eternity: but that Heaven as muſt be rolled up like a ſcroll, it is the Air and Clouds of Heaven, as aforeſaid.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI.</head>
               <p>IN the 7 chapter it is ſaid, <hi>And after theſe things I ſaw four Angels ſtanding on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind ſhould not blow on the earth, nor on the Sea, nor on any tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe four Angels that <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion, which had power to hold the four winds, that the wind might not blow, they were four Angels of pure reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62818:45"/>Who had a Commiſſion from God to hold the four winds, that they ſhould not blow upon the earth, nor upon the ſea, nor upon any tree.</p>
               <p>For if God ſhould but take away the four winds from blowing upon the earth, ſea, and trees, all creatures would immediately periſh and die.</p>
               <p>So that theſe four Angels which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion which had ſuch power over the four winds, it was onely to ſignifie what ſhall be at the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall theſe four Angels execute their office, ſo that the four winds ſhall not blow.</p>
               <p>But there is ſomething elſe to be done in the interim, for though the four Angels have their Commiſſion from God to do that work, yet they muſt ſtay till ſuch time as another work muſt be done.</p>
               <p>As you may ſee in the 2 verſe, <hi>And</hi> John <hi>ſaw another Angel aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from the eaſt, having the Seal of the living God, and he cryed with a loud voice to the four Angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth, and the ſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Angel that aſcended from the Eaſt, it was Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he having the Seal of the living God; he muſt needs have the Seal of the living God, he being the living God himſelf.</p>
               <p>He gave order to the other four Angels, that they ſhould not put their Commiſſion in execution until he had ſealed the ſervants of God in their foreheads.</p>
               <p>For it is Chriſt that ſealeth every ſervant of his in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, in that they do receive the holy ſpirit of promiſe, whereby they are ſealed up unto the day of Redemption.</p>
               <p>And when the ſoul is ſealed, and can witneſs in his ſpirit the aſſurance of his ſalvation, he may be ſaid to be ſealed in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Johns</hi> ſaying, this Angel that had the ſeal of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, he aſcended from the eaſt, it is ſpoken with relation of Chriſts coming out of the eaſt at his birth, to work the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thoſe that he now doth ſeal, with the Seal of the living God.</p>
               <p>That is, with his own holy Spirit, witneſſing to their ſpirits the aſſurance of eternal life by his death.</p>
               <p>Which they by faith do ſet to their ſeal: So that they by faith
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62818:45"/>
do ſeal to the truth of the thing, and he doth ſeal the aſſurance of everlaſting life unto their conſciences; and this is the ſeal of the living God in their foreheads.</p>
               <p>And in the 4 verſe, John <hi>heard the number of them which were ſealed, and there were ſealed an hundred and forty and four thouſand, of all the tribes of the children of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Now it is not to be underſtood that <hi>John</hi> did mean exactly ſuch a number and no more, that were ſealed.</p>
               <p>But if the ſpirit of revelation will call a hundred hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, but a hundred and forty four thouſand, who ſhall gainſay it?</p>
               <p>But in regard there is an equal number ſpoken of by <hi>John</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tribe, it is according to reaſons account no more then one hundred forty and four thouſand, that were ſealed of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore whether they were more or leſs ſealed with the ſeal of the living God, I ſhall not diſpute the thing.</p>
               <p>Neither is it much material to know, ſo that I ſhall paſs by the rehearſing of the Tribes, and come to the nineth verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>After this I beheld, and lo a great multitude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues, flood before the throne, and before the Lamb cloathed in white robes, and palms in their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great multitude which no man could number, they were the Gentiles that were brought to the faith of the Goſpel in the time of the Apoſtles Commiſſion, which did laſt a matter of three hundred years, then was all tongues nations, kindreds, and people brought to the Faith of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And theſe were that great multitude which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe were thoſe that <hi>John</hi> ſaw ſtand before the Throne, and before the Lamb: theſe were thoſe he ſaw cloathed in white Robes.</p>
               <p>Now what theſe white Robes is, I have ſhewed before; not but that there hath, and will be many thouſands of the Gentiles, tongues, and nations ſince that time, that will be ſaved</p>
               <p>But theſe that <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion, it was chiefly thoſe Saints in the Apoſtles Commiſſion, and it was them that he ſaw in the 10 verſe, to cry with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Salvation to our God
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62818:46"/>
which ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb.</hi> And in the 11 verſe, <hi>All the Angels ſtood round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and the four beaſts, ſo that all the holy Angels, and the Elders, and the four beaſts fell on their faces and worſhipped God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Angels, and Elders, and the four beaſts had faces, elſe they could not fall on their faces to worſhip God.</p>
               <p>For God hath a face of his own, and thoſe that worſhip him muſt have faces alſo.</p>
               <p>Elſe they cannot worſhip God; alſo they muſt have a tongue to ſay, <hi>Bleſſing, and glory, and wiſdom, thankſgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Angels, Elders, and thoſe four beaſts had tongues to praiſe the living God.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>John</hi> being in a great amaze in the viſion to ſee ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude which no man could number, to ſtand before the Throne of God, all in white robes.</p>
               <p>He in the 14 verſe, asketh one of the Elders what theſe be that are arayed in white robes? And he ſaid unto <hi>John, Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what is meant by the white Robes, and being waſhed in the blood of the Lamb, I have ſhewed before, and what is meant by the Throne: ſo that to the end of the ſeventh chapter, it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſignifie the glory of the Redeemed ones, who were and are waſhed in their ſouls here in this life in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>They ſhall ſerve him day and night in his temple in heaven, and ſtand before his Throne of glory where he is.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhall there be any more hunger, nor thirſt, neither ſhall the heat of perſecution light any more upon them.</p>
               <p>Nor the natural ſun to offend them any more by its extream heat;</p>
               <p>For in this kingdom of heaven where the Lamb is, in the midſt of the Throne, he ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of water:</p>
               <p>And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes: this is that glorious and happy condition that all the ſaints ſhall have, who have got thoſe white Robes of the righteouſneſs of faith, being waſhed in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:62818:46"/>And this will be at the end of time, yet Faith doth look upon this condition immediately after the end of this natural life.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſaid by <hi>John,</hi> as if the thing were already done and accompliſhed to him, and to every one that is gone out of this world it is ſo, but to us that are alive, it is not yet accompliſhed. So much for the interpretation of the ſeventh Chapter.</p>

               <p>THe eight chapter, in the firſt verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And when he had opened the ſeventh Seal, there was ſilence in heaven about the ſpace of half an hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to underſtand, that theſe ſeven Seals which were opened in Heaven, they were thoſe ſeven Seals that were on the backſide of the Book of Life, as I ſhewed before; which were the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe it is Chriſt that doth open the ſeven Seals, and at the opening of every Seal <hi>John</hi> ſaw ſome extraordinary ſight in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, either deſtruction upon the wicked, and perſecution upon the Saints, or bleſſings upon the Saints.</p>
               <p>So that the opening of every Seal produced ſomething new to <hi>John</hi> in his viſion.</p>
               <p>But in the opening of the ſeventh Seal, there was ſilence in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven about the ſpace of half an hour.</p>
               <p>That is, there was a little ſpace of time between the opening of the other ſix Seals, before this ſeventh Seal was opened.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>John</hi> had ſome little ſpace of time before the opening of the ſeventh Seal was ſhewed unto him.</p>
               <p>And this is that he calls <hi>ſilence in Heaven about the ſpace of half an hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might be forty hours for ought we know; but if he ſaith half an hour, who ſhall gainſay it?</p>
               <p>But ſure I am, it was a little ſpace of time between the opening of the other ſix Seals, before the ſeventh Seal was opened unto his underſtanding.</p>
               <p>For he made no ſtop in opening the ſix Seals before.</p>
               <p>And as there was ſomething did follow upon the opening of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the ſix Seals, ſo there doth follow ſomething upon the opening of the ſeventh Seal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:62818:47"/>For in the 2 verſe, John <hi>ſaw the ſeven Angels which ſtood before God, and to them were given ſeven Trumpets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeven Angels which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion, I declare they were the Miniſtery of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe being thoſe ſeven Angels which <hi>John</hi> did write unto, as I ſaid before; for theſe ſeven Angels which <hi>John</hi> did write unto in the ſecond chapter, it was to ſignifie thoſe great tribulations and ſufferings, that the Miniſtery and the Churches themſelves ſhould undergo.</p>
               <p>But in the eighth chapter <hi>John</hi> ſaw theſe ſeven Angels, which were the Miniſters of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>He ſaw them now as if they were in a ſtate of glory.</p>
               <p>And now inſtead of tribulation for ten days; which ten days was the ten perſecutions, which did laſt a matter of three hundred years, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>I ſay, now he ſaw theſe <hi>ſeven Angels ſtand before God, and to them were given ſeven Trumpets;</hi> that is, each of them had trumpets given unto them: So that every one of them might ſound forth ſome Plague, and Judgement or other upon the earth where wicked men doth dwell who perſecuted the innocent to the death.</p>
               <p>And in the 3 verſe it is ſaid, <hi>Another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a golden cenſer, and there was given unto him much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe that he ſhould offer it, with the prayers of all Saints, upon the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den altar which was before the Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Angel I declare was <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was to officiate the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of offering up the prayers of all the Saints, with the incenſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the golden altar, which was before the Throne in the viſion, as he did in his Commiſſion of the Law, when he was here upon earth.</p>
               <p>So that he is called by <hi>Johns</hi> revelation, <hi>Another Angel that came and ſtood at the altar,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in the 4 verſe, <hi>The ſmoak of the incenſe which came with the prayers of the Saints,</hi> aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand.</p>
               <p>And in the 5 verſe, <hi>And the Angel took the cenſer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and caſt it into the earth, and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an Earthquake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:62818:47"/>This is ſpoken with relation to thoſe offerings, which <hi>Moſes</hi> the Angel of the Covenant of works did practice in the time of the Law.</p>
               <p>And as he was the Angel that gave forth the Law, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordained Cenſers, Altars, and Offerings to be offered up unto the Lord in that Tabernacle, which was but a pattern of the true;</p>
               <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi> is that Angel that is ſaid by <hi>John</hi> in his viſion, to offer up the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne.</p>
               <p>It is called, <hi>a Golden Altar,</hi> becauſe it is ſpiritual and heavenly, and the ſacrifice which is the prayers of Saints, is ſpiritual alſo.</p>
               <p>In oppoſition to that altar and ſacrifices <hi>Moſes</hi> had in the time of the Law.</p>
               <p>So that when the Angel had offered up the prayers of all the Saints, and the ſmoak of the incenſe, and the Saints Prayers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand.</p>
               <p>And when this was accompliſhed, the Angel took the Cenſer, and filled it with fire, and caſt it into the earth.</p>
               <p>Onely to ſignifie ſome extraordinary Plagues and Judgements that ſhould follow upon the ſounding of every one of the ſeven Angels Trumpets.</p>
               <p>Now I would have you the Seed of Faith to conſider, that as there was a real, viſible, and temporal altar, ſacrifice, incenſe, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, uſed in the viſible worſhip in the time of the Law, the very ſame things are expreſſed by <hi>John</hi> in a ſpiritual ſenſe, both by way of viſion and revelation.</p>
               <p>So that what <hi>Moſes</hi> did as he was the Angel of the Covenant of works, and viſible worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> doth expreſs it in a ſpiritual and heavenly ſenſe.</p>
               <p>So that there is a true reality in the ſpiritual ſenſe though inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which cannot be ſeen but by the eye of Faith, as the temporal was ſeen and known by the eye of reaſon.</p>
               <p>So that thoſe Judgements a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d Plagues that were acted in <hi>Moſes</hi> Commiſſion, they are rehearſed by <hi>John</hi> over again in a ſpiritual ſenſe;</p>
               <p>So that the things that three of theſe ſeven Angels did, the Plagues that doth appear upon the earth at the ſounding of their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62818:48"/>
trumpets, they were fulfilled in the Commiſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was of the Law.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is worth the minding, to know what Plagues did follow upon the ſounding of every one of theſe ſeven Angels which had ſeven trumpets prepared themſelves to ſound.</p>
               <p>For obſerve, that when the Angel aforeſaid, had took the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and filled it with fire of the altar, and caſt it into the earth, it produced immediately, <hi>there were voices, and thunderings, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and an Earthquake;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe upon the ſounding of the ſeven Trumpets which the ſeven Angels had which prepared themſelves to ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt Angel ſounded, and there followed hail, and fire mingled with blood; and they were caſt upon the earth, and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green graſs was burnt up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Plague that followed upon the firſt Angels ſounding, was upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people, when <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent of God to him to let the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go into the wilderneſs to worſhip.</p>
               <p>I need not to relate the particular Plagues, becauſe they may be read in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But at the firſt Angels ſounding, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people had that Hail, and Fire mingled with blood, amongſt them; ſo that other great Plagues were upon man and beaſt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as you may read concerning thoſe ſeven Plagues which <hi>Moſes</hi> brought upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not let the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go: and this was the fruits of the firſt Angel ſounding his trumpet.</p>
               <p>And in the eighth verſe, <hi>And the ſecond Angel ſounded, and as it were a great Mountain burning with fire was caſt into the ſea, and the third part of the ſea became blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the ninth verſe, <hi>The third part of creatures which were in the ſea, and had life, died, and the third part of ſhips were deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great Mountain burning with fire which was caſt into the ſea, when the ſecond Angel did ſound, was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſt; for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a great Mountain, that is, a King of great power</p>
               <p>And he burned with the fire of envy and madneſs, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be carried out of his kingdom, and enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Egyptians Jewels, and other things which they had borrowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:62818:48"/>It was enough to make this great Mountain to burn with the fire of madneſs and revenge:</p>
               <p>So that he and all his hoſt would follow to the Sea ſide, that his wrath might burn as a fire of revenge upon the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and bring them back again.</p>
               <p>But in the concluſion, this great Mountain that burned with the fire of revenge, was caſt into the ſea.</p>
               <p>That is, King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the great Mountain, and all his hoſt, who burned with revenge like fire, were caſt into the ſea</p>
               <p>So that the third part of the ſea may be ſaid to become blood, becauſe the deſtruction was exceeding great; ſo that the their part of the creatures which were in the ſea, and had life, died, and the third part of the ſhips were deſtroyed; that is, the third part of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> kingdom were caſt into the ſea:</p>
               <p>So that though the poor creatures had life when they were in the midſt of the ſea following of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſea ſwallowed them up, ſo that the third part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Egypt</hi> died in the ſea.</p>
               <p>And the third part of ſhips were deſtroyed: That is, the third part of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Charriots and Waggons which the kingdome would afford, were deſtroyed in the ſea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> calls them ſhips, becauſe they carried him into the ſea, and after they were deſtroyed, the Charriots ſwum up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>For when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was drowned, we do not read that he, nor no Nation elſe had any ſhips, but what hath been builded ſince.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And the life of his horſes, and his mules, and his men, were the third part of creatures which died in the ſea.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For when the Angel doth ſound, there is always ſome great trouble upon the earth attends to one or more particular Nations.</p>
               <p>As there was in the days of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and more eſpecially in the days of <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet, when as the King of <hi>Syria</hi> warred with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but was prevented by the Prophet <hi>Eliſhas</hi> counſel.</p>
               <p>As you may read 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> and the ſixth Chapter, beginning at the eighth verſe, how many times he prevented the King of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi> But in proceſs of time another King of <hi>Syria</hi> came againſt <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> as in the 14 verſe of this Chapter; ſo that there was a great and extream famine in <hi>Samaria,</hi> as may be read in that Chapter.</p>
               <p>But this King of <hi>Syria</hi> was diſappointed alſo; And in proceſs of time there aroſe another King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which came up againſt <hi>Samaria</hi> and beſieged it, and at the three years end took it, as in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> chap. 13. verſe 8.</p>
               <p>So in the 18 chapter, verſe 13. <hi>In the fourteenth year of the reign of King</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>did the King of</hi> Aſſyria <hi>come up againſt all the fenced Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>and took them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further he went on, until he came to beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with great high boaſting words againſt the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as he did againſt other idol gods;</p>
               <p>Which he caſt into the fire, as <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> the ſervant of the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> doth declare, as the Hiſtory doth abundantly relate.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> did ſend to the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to enquire of the Lord, as in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. verſe 2. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> put the king in good comfort, that the Lord would deſtroy the king of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and his hoſt, as afterwards was done, according to the words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as may be read in the Chapter aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Now this king of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the other kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the king of <hi>Moab</hi> that rebelled againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but eſpecially this great king of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> was that great Star which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion

               <p>The noiſe of this burned like a Lamp in other Kings hearts, with fear that they and their gods ſhould be ſerved ſo.</p>
               <p>And ſo it did prove, as you may read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> the 19. chapter and the 12 verſe, what a many kings and gods did he deſtroy?</p>

               <p>So that his heart was lifted up with pride, even as a great Star in heaven, ſo that he thought to do by the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> in whom <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did truſt, as he did by thoſe wooden gods which other nations did worſhip.</p>
               <p>Therefore he proudly ſaith, <hi>What God ſhall deliver Hezekiah the King out of his hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that he burned as a Lamp with fear and terror both to the King and all <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo that Kings are called <hi>Stars,</hi> as it is ſaid in Scripture ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>A Star ſhall come out of</hi> Jacob.</p>
               <p>So that Chriſt being the King of the Jews, he is called a <hi>Star.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe this great King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> who had overcome ſo many Kings, and had burned all their wooden gods, who thought to do ſo to <hi>Judah,</hi> he was that Star that fell from heaven burning as it were a lamp.</p>
               <p>It fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters: this Star is ſaid to burn like a lamp, in regard he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered ſo many Kings, and burned their gods with fire.</p>
               <p>And this Star is ſaid to fall upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters, becauſe he fell upon thoſe kings that were ſcituated by <hi>Jordan</hi> and the Sea-coaſt, &amp; many kings did

               <p>ANd in the eleventh verſe, <hi>John ſaith, the name of the Star is called</hi> Wormwood, <hi>and the third part of the waters became Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,

and many men died of the waters, becauſe they were made bitter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>John</hi> calls the Name of this Star aforeſaid <hi>Wormwood,</hi> in regard it made the third part of the waters it fell upon to be Wormwood alſo;</p>
               <p>For many men that drank of theſe waters, which this Star fell upon, died, becauſe they were made bitter.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that when the men of thoſe Iſlands or Lands did ſally out, or any other ways to get water out of thoſe rivers or fountains, to give themſelves and their cattel drink,</p>
               <p>Then the feet of this Star, that is, his ſouldiers fell upon thoſe men and killed them.</p>
               <p>So that the waters became bitter, and that many men died of the waters; for the waters were good of themſelves, but they could get none of them, neither could they get any water no where elſe, ſo that they muſt have of thoſe Rivers and Fountains of water where the Star fell, or elſe they muſt periſh both men and beaſt for want of water.</p>
               <p>So that they were forced to drink of thoſe bitter waters, though they died with it.</p>
               <p>For the Star whoſe name was <hi>Wormwood</hi> was fallen upon them, that is, he had beſieged the waters ſo in every place, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters became as bitter as Wormwood.</p>
               <p>So that whoſoever did drink of them without the Stars leave, he muſt die.</p>
               <p>So that the waters became bitter indeed; likewiſe many of <hi>Judah</hi> did drink of theſe bitter waters, and as you may ſee, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 8 and the 7.</p>
               <p>In the 6 verſe <hi>Judah</hi> is blamed for refuſing the waters of <hi>Shiloah,</hi> and many other waters; therefore in the ſeventh verſe it is ſaid, <hi>Now, behold the Lord bringeth up upon the waters of the river, ſtrong and many, even the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and all his glory, and he ſhall come up over all his Channels, and go over all his Banks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this Star whoſe name is <hi>Wormwood,</hi> muſt go over the Channels and Banks of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and make their waters as bitter as Wormwood.</p>
               <p>So that they muſt many of them die of the waters alſo.</p>
               <p>As it is ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9 ver. 15. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>behold, I will feed them, even this people, with Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and give them water of Gall to drink.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:62818:51"/>So that beſieged waters are called by the revelation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of <hi>John, Wormwood of waters,</hi>

               <p>And bitter waters, and many are ſaid to die of the waters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were bitter.</p>
               <p>It is becauſe of the drought, in that the Star, the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> or any other power hath beſieged or ſet guard upon the waters, and ſo the waters becometh as bitter as Gall or Wormwood to thoſe that ſhall drink of thoſe rivers or fountains of water which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</p>
               <p>They become as bitter as Gall or Wormwood, and many men died of the waters, in that they were bitter.</p>
               <p>They were bitter indeed, in that many men loſt their lives in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to drink of them.</p>
               <p>That is, they were ſlain by the King of <hi>Aſſyrias</hi> hoſt, who was that Star, whoſe name is called by <hi>Johns</hi> Revelation, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</p>

               <p>So much for the ſounding of the three Angels.</p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to underſtand, that there was other Kings that beſieged the waters and fountains of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Judah, Moab,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and divers other kingdoms, ſo that their waters became Wormwood and bitter.</p>
               <p>So that many men died of the waters, they being made bitter, in that they were beſiged by the enemy.</p>
               <p>So that what King or power ſoever did act after the ſame nature and manner as the Star did, aforeſaid,</p>
               <p>It may all be called but <hi>one Star,</hi> which name of the Star is called <hi>Wormwood,</hi> which made the waters bitter, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>So that many men died of the waters, and this was at the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the third Angel.</p>
               <p>So that what things hath been acted of that nature by any other Kings beſides the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> between the ſounding of the third Angel and the fourth Angel, they are all included under one Star.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:62818:51"/>For at the ſounding of every Angel, there is ſome differing Judgement did follow upon it.</p>
               <p>So that theſe three Angels that ſounded, they were fulfilled in the time of the Law.</p>
               <p>But at the ſounding of the fourth Angel, the Law and the Goſpel are joyned together.</p>
               <p>That is, the end of the Law and the beginning of the Goſpel, were now tyed cloſe together as one thing, by the ſounding of the fourth Angel.</p>

               <p>Onely they differ ſomething in every Angels ſounding.</p>

               <p>THe twelfth verſe of this chapter, <hi>And the fourth Angel ſounded, and the third part of the Sun was ſmitten, and the third part of the Moon, and the third part of the Stars, ſo as the third part of them was darkned, and the day ſhone not for a third part of it, and the night likewiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning I declare is this, it is ſpoken with relation to Chriſt, and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and the Rulers of the Jews.</p>
               <p>The third part of the Sun being ſmitten, it was with relation to Chriſts ſufferings.</p>
               <p>He being the Sun of righteouſneſs, and the head of the Goſpel; that heavenly light that ſhined from him, it was as the light of the Sun to all thoſe that believed him</p>
               <p>But he being ſmitten with perſecution and ſuffering while he lived, it may be ſaid that the third part of the Sun was darkned.</p>
               <p>So that the Sun could not ſhine ſo bright as it would have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62818:52"/>For never any man ſpake like him, neither had ever any man that wiſdom and power as he had.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>Never any wan ſpake like this man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither did any man ſpeak forth that wiſdom as he did; for he is ſaid to be the <hi>wiſdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He muſt needs be the wiſdom of God, he being God himſelf, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this he was ſmitten with ſufferings, ſo that his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and righteouſneſs could not ſhine forth ſo bright and clear, as it would have done, onely a third part of it did ſhine.</p>
               <p>That is, truth took place in the hearts of ſome few that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him.</p>
               <p>So that the light of heaven did not ſhine into the hearts of the generality of the people of the Jews, becauſe they ſaw ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings did attend the believing in him.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid, many believed on him, but durſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him, becauſe of the ſufferings they ſaw would follow.</p>
               <p>So that this Jeſus which ſignifies the Sun, was ſmitten with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and ſufferings in the time of his Miniſtery, that there could but a third part of his heavenly light ſhine upon the people of the Jews.</p>
               <p>And happy were thoſe that this light did ſhine upon.</p>
               <p>But the generality of the people did ſmite this Sun with perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ſo that they could ſee no heavenly light in him at all, ſo that the Sun did not ſhine upon them at all.</p>
               <p>So that he became as darkneſs unto them, not yielding them any true ſpiritual and heavenly peace in their ſouls; ſo that the light of this Sun ſhined not at all upon their hearts, but was darkneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p>For this was he that did make their hearts fat, ſo that they might not ſee any ſaving light in him.</p>
               <p>For they were to ſmite the Sun with envy and malice, ſo that he might not ſhine upon their ſouls any of that heavenly light which was in him.</p>
               <p>Therefore he ſpake in parables and dark ſentences, that they might not underſtand.</p>
               <p>But unto his diſciples it was given them to underſtand the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And this is the ſpiritual meaning of the Sun being ſmitten at the ſounding of the fourth Angel.</p>
               <p>The Moon alſo was ſmitten, ſo that a third part of her did ſhine.</p>
               <p>Now I would have the Seed of Faith to underſtand what is meant by the Moon.</p>
               <p>This Moon I declare it doth ſignifie the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Goſpel doth the Son of God, which was Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And as the Goſpel of Jeſus was, or Jeſus himſelf was the Sun that was ſmitten, as aforeſaid;</p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did ſignifie the Moon.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he was the laſt Prophet of the Law, as I have ſhewed in <hi>The interpretation of the Eleventh chapter of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he being ſmitten and put in priſon, and afterwards put to death, the third part of the Moon may be ſaid to be ſmitten.</p>
               <p>So that a third part of the light of the Moon was put out or darkned, that is, the light or righteouſneſs of the Law, a third part of it was darkned when <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was ſmitten, he ſignifying the Moon, as he was the laſt Prophet of the Law.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Rulers of the Jews were the third part of the Stars that were darkned alſo.</p>
               <p>For they were ſmitten alſo at the ſounding of the fourth Angel.</p>
               <p>That is, they were ſmitten with fear, trouble, and wrath in their mindes, that righteouſneſs could not be had by the Law.</p>
               <p>So that the light, joy, and peace that they received before by the righteouſneſs of the Law, it is now ſmitten and darkned.</p>
               <p>For by the preaching of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who tells them of another righteouſneſs then that of the Law, even the righteouſneſs of Faith in the Son of God.</p>
               <p>So that he bids them bring forth fruits of repentance, that is a better fruit then that of the Law, that is, a better righteouſneſs then the righteouſneſs of the Law.</p>
               <p>Therefore he tells them that he which did follow after him,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62818:53"/>
meaning Chriſt, whoſe ſhooes latchets he was not worthy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſe, that they ſhould look and minde him, he would tell them of a righteouſneſs of Faith, which was a better righteouſneſs then that of the Law,</p>
               <p>Which would yield them more peace and ſatisfaction to their mindes, then the righteouſneſs of the Law would.</p>
               <p>For the righteouſneſs of the Law, though performed very exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will be but as the light of the Moon in mens minds.</p>
               <p>But the righteouſneſs of Faith which the Goſpel ſignifies, it ſhines in the minde of man as the Sun at Noon-day.</p>
               <p>So that the worſhippers in the Law were the third part of the Stars that were ſmitten at the fourth Angels ſounding.</p>
               <p>And this fourth Angel ſounded until the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as the Sun was ſmitten, as aforeſaid, ſo likewiſe the Moon and Stars were ſmitten alſo.</p>
               <p>The Moon was ſmitten firſt in <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> he being the laſt Prophet of the Law, as aforeſaid: he ſmote the hearts of the Rulers of the Jews with the declaration of a Chriſt that would bring another righteouſneſs and worſhip, then that of the Law,</p>
               <p>Which would yield them more peace, if they could believe.</p>
               <p>So that they became ſo ſmitten in their mindes, that they fell a perſecuting and ſmote him, and ſmote the Sun alſo.</p>
               <p>But in a while after the Moon and Stars were ſmitten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>That is, at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Romans, the Moon and Stars were ſmitten.</p>
               <p>That is, the worſhip of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> which ſignifies the Moon, it was ſmitten.</p>
               <p>And the Rulers of the Jews, which were the Stars, were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Romans.</p>
               <p>So that a third part of the Moon hath been darkened ever ſince, and a third part of the Stars have been darkened ever ſince.</p>
               <p>For the worſhip of the Law, which ſignifies the Moon, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet up ſince not in his brightneſs, neither hath the Stars, that is, the Rulers of the Jews, any power to ſet up that worſhip of the Law, or to puniſh any that doth not ſubmit unto it.</p>
               <p>So that the third part of the Stars are ſo ſmitten, that they are become darkened.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62818:53"/>So that you that have faith may know, that the Goſpel which which did ſignifie the Sun, was ſmitten and darkened when Jeſus was ſmitten at his firſt coming, to the day of his death; therefore called by the <hi>Revelation of</hi> John, <hi>the third part of the Sun was ſmitten and darkened, and ſhined not for a third part of the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Law, that ſignifies the Moon, it was ſmitten and darkened, firſt in <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and ſo were the Stars alſo</p>
               <p>But afterwards at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Moon and Stars were both ſmitten and darkened, ſo that a third part of the Moon and Stars did give no light in the night.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the light of the natural Moon and Stars, it is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place when they ſhine, to give light in the night.</p>
               <p>But I have ſpoken more of the Moon in <hi>The interpretation of the Eleventh of the Revelation,</hi> therefore I ſhall ſpeak no more of it here.</p>
               <p>Onely this, to remind the Seed of Faith what great judgements did enſue upon the ſounding of this fourth Angel.</p>
               <p>Perſecution of the Goſpel, perſecution of the Law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Jews, which were the Stars.</p>
               <p>Theſe things were at the ſounding of the fourth Angel.</p>
               <p>You whoſe underſtandings are inlightned, may ſee what hath followed upon the ſounding of the Trumpet of theſe four Angels.</p>
               <p>And how this fourth Angel it ſounded half upon the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and half upon the Goſpel of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>So that now there is three Angels more to ſound, and great woes will follow upon it.</p>
               <p>As it is ſaid in the laſt verſe of this chapter, <hi>Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by reaſon of the other voices of the Trumpets of the three Angels that are yet to ſound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there will follow a great woe upon the ſounding of theſe three Angels.</p>
               <p>Which I ſhall unfold in order as they follow in the next chapter.</p>
               <p>So I ſhall ſay no more of this, I having given the interpretation in ſhort of all the chief things of concernment in the eighth chapter.</p>

               <p>CHapter the nineth, <hi>At the ſounding of the fifth Angel, in the firſt verſe,</hi> John <hi>ſaw a Star fall from heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the Key of the bottomleſs pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Star that fell from heaven unto the earth, it was that beaſt or king that did ariſe out of the Sea, which is ſpoken of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> the 13 chapter and the firſt verſe.</p>
               <p>This beaſt was one of <hi>Herods,</hi> the Dragons ſons, and the next beaſt that did ariſe after him.</p>
               <p>And this beaſt he was like a Leopard, <hi>and he had ſeven heads and ten horns, and the Dragon gave him his power and authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this beaſt had Crowns upon his ten horns.</p>
               <p>And upon his heads the name of <hi>blaſphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that he was furniſhed with the Dragons power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his blaſphemy, to deſpiſe the living God, and to perſecute the Saints, as his father the Dragon did when he perſecuted Chriſt at his birth, and made war with the remnant of his ſeed.</p>
               <p>So that this beaſt which aroſe out of the Sea, he may be ſaid to be a Star that fell from heaven unto the earth, becauſe he was one of the Dragons ſons;</p>
               <p>For <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſaw a wonder in heaven, a great red Dragon that perſecuted the woman,</hi> which red Dragon was no other but <hi>Herod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Star which fell from heaven unto the earth, it was <hi>Herods</hi> firſt-born ſon, therefore called a Star that fell from heaven unto the earth.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid to fall from heaven, becauſe this Star was of the ſame ſeed or nature as the Dragon was of.</p>
               <p>For it is ſaid by <hi>John, that he ſaw a wonder in heaven, a great red Dragon;</hi> this red Dragon is ſaid to be in heaven.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he had the ſpirit or ſeed of the fallen Angel in him in a great and extraordinary meaſure.</p>
               <p>Which Angel was firſt in heaven, he being created an Angel of light, but was thrown down unto this earth when he deceived <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither did that Angel that deceived her, ever aſcend up into heaven again to this day, nor never ſhall.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Herod</hi> and his ſons, and all wicked kings and rulers, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62818:54"/>
of the fallen Angels ſeed, they may be ſaid to fall from heaven.</p>
               <p>And they being of his ſeed, they may be called a <hi>Dragon,</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, a Serpent, a Devil, and Stars.</p>
               <p>Though they act ſeveral ways, yet all from one root, that is, from one ſeed, even from the ſpirit or ſeed of the fallen Angel, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any Head-magiſtrate or man doth act after the manner of a Dragon, he may be ſaid to be a Dragon, as <hi>Herod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any man act after the manner of a ſubtile ſerpent, as thoſe Jews did that tempted Chriſt, they may be called <hi>Serpents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any man act the part of a devil, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, he may be called a <hi>devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any king doth act as a Star that burneth like a Lamp, or more worſe, this Star did, that fell at the ſounding of the fifth angel, they may be called <hi>Stars</hi> that fal from heaven unto the earth.</p>
               <p>Becauſe, as I ſaid before, the original or father of all wickedneſs even the fallen Angel, he was thrown down from heaven unto this earth.</p>
               <p>And the Dragon, Serpent, Devil, and Stars, they being of his ſeed, they may be ſaid by the Revelation of <hi>John,</hi> to fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto this earth.</p>
               <p>For when the Angel was thrown down from heaven unto this earth, his ſeed was all thrown down unto this earth with him.</p>
               <p>And this earth hath, and is the devils kingdom ever ſince, and will be to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe it may be ſaid that this Star fell from heaven unto the earth, and to him, that is, unto this Star, <hi>was given the Key of the bottomleſs pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the ſecond verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And he opened the bottomleſs pit, and there aroſe a ſmoke out of the pit as the ſmoke of a great fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and the Sun and the Air were darkned by reaſon of the ſmoke of the pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This bottomleſs pit here ſpoken of, it is the imagination of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in man; for the imagination of mans heart is continually evil, or bottomleſs, or topleſs.</p>
               <p>That is, the imagination of Reaſon cannot finde out what God is, nor where he is; nor what the devil is, nor where he is, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he is the devil himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62818:55"/>That is, the ſpirit of Reaſon, which is the ſoul of man, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and the imaginations that proceeds from it, is that bottomleſs pit the Scriptures ſpeaketh of.</p>
               <p>It is bottomleſs, becauſe it is eteenal; for that which is eternal hath no end, therefore no bottom, ſo called by the Spirit <hi>A bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit:</hi> and he that had the key of the bottomleſs pit, was the <hi>Star</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this: He may be ſaid to open the bottomleſs pit, in that he had power given him to command the dark reaſon and imaginations of the idolatrous peoples hearts, to come forth to fight for his Crown and Dignity, and for the Image and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which he did ſet up.</p>
               <p>Now he had power given him of the Angel of the bottomleſs pit, that is, from the fallen Angel aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>He being the Angel of the bottomleſs pit, as it is ſaid in the eleventh verſe of this Chapter, <hi>And they had a King over them, which is the Angel of the bottomleſs pit, whoſe name is</hi> Abaddon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to underſtand, that from this king, the Angel of the bottomleſs pit, did <hi>Herod</hi> the Dragon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his power;</p>
               <p>He being that beaſt that did aſcend out of the bottomleſs pit, which is ſpoken of in the eleventh Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which I have opened already.</p>
               <p>And this Dragon gave his power to this Star, ſo that the Angel of the bottomleſs pit did give power to his own ſeed or ſons ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, ſo that the Angels ſons are called by ſeveral names.</p>
               <p>And this ſon which had the key of the bottomleſs pit, and had power given him to open it, he is called <hi>A Star that fell from heaven unto the earth;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all wicked Kings and Magiſtrates who are the ſeed of the fallen Angel, they are called <hi>Stars,</hi> becauſe the firſt original of them was from heaven.</p>
               <p>But as that ſeed is become mortal, they may be ſaid to fall unto the earth: and here it is that they work all their wickedneſs, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and idolatry againſt God.</p>
               <p>And the bottomleſs pit is in the earth alſo; for there is no other bottomleſs pit but the imagination of mans heart, and out of this bottomleſs pit cometh all manner of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62818:55"/>And when this bottomleſs pit is opened either by the Law, or Command of the good Magiſtrate or the bad, there will ariſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, fear, wrath, and envy out of it.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Star</hi> that had power given him, he was a wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; for when he opened the bottomleſs pit by his power and command, <hi>there aroſe a ſmoke out of the pit as the ſmoke of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. And the Sun and the Air were darkned, by reaſon of the ſmoke of the pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this ſmoke that did ariſe out of the bottomleſs pit of his own and his peoples imaginations, and the pride of their hearts, it was his and their breathings forth of blaſphemy againſt the living God, and revenge upon all thoſe that would not ſubmit to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as they did.</p>
               <p>And this ſmoke which was breathed forth from himſelf and his people, it did darken the Sun and the Air.</p>
               <p>That is, it made the Faith and Worſhip of the Goſpel which did ſignifie the Sun, to be darkned, ſo that the Worſhip of the Goſpel could not be ſeen to ſhine for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Air was darkned alſo.</hi> The Air doth ſignifie the light of reaſon: That is, the very light of reaſon was ſo darkned, that they could not worſhip God according to the light of reaſon.</p>
               <p>For the ſmoke of the pit was ſo great, that is, ignorant, dark, and idolatrous worſhip was breathed and threatned forth, that it became like the ſmoke of a great furnace, ſo that no Sun or Air could be ſeen.</p>
               <p>That is, the idolatrous dark worſhip was ſo great and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the earth, and the threatnings againſt any other worſhip, it being the ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit, it darkned the Sun and the Air, that they could not be ſeen for ſmoke.</p>
               <p>That is, no Worſhip of the Goſpel, nor Worſhip of the Law, which was the light of Reaſon; which ſignifies the Air, could be ſeen by reaſon of the ſmoke of the pit.</p>
               <p>For as the ſmoke is great that doth ariſe from a furnace, ſo that it doth dazle the light of the fire and candle, that it cannot be ſeen what is in the furnace;</p>
               <p>So the ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit was ſo great, that the light of the Sun and the Air was darkned, that none could ſee into the bottomleſs pit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62818:56"/>That is, the light of the Goſpel, nor the light of the Law, could not penetrate thorow the ſmoke of the pit to ſee what was in it.</p>
               <p>The breathings forth of blaſphemy and idolatry was ſo great, that it darkned the Sun and the Air, as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>ANd in verſe the third, <hi>And there came out of the ſmoke locuſts upon the earth, and unto them was given power as the Scorpions of the earth have power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe locuſts that came out of the ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit, I declare they were men, though called by the revelation of <hi>John, Locuſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it was the power of the <hi>Stars</hi> command that opened the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit of his own imagination, and that breathed out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt all that would not obey his command.</p>
               <p>So that there aroſe out of the ſmoke of his imagination, a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of locuſts, that is, a multitude of wicked men; and theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men ſhould have power given, as the ſcorpions of the earth have power:</p>
               <p>That is, this <hi>Star</hi> did give Commiſſion to thoſe locuſts that came out of the ſmoke, they had power given them by his Commiſſion to ſpread themſelves upon the earth.</p>
               <p>And as the natural ſcorpions of the earth have power to hurt, or ſting any they ſhall light upon, ſo likewiſe theſe locuſts that came out of the ſmoke of the pit, they alſo had power to hurt men whomſoever they did light upon.</p>
               <p>Onely this their power was limited by a ſecret providence, it was commanded them verſe 4. <hi>That they ſhould not hurt the graſs of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but onely thoſe men which have not the ſeal of God in their foreheads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The green graſs, and green things, and tree, did ſignifie the Saints that ſh uld not be hurt.</p>
               <p>For though the ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit had darkned the Sun and the Air, in that they durſt not worſhip according to the Law, nor Goſpel not publick, becauſe of the ſmoke aforeſaid,</p>
               <p>Yet the Saints were not to be put to death, nor hurt by theſe locuſts, not for a certain time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:62818:56"/>For the Saints did forbear outward and publick Worſhip of the Goſpel for a ſeaſon, ſo that the locuſts did not hurt them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſecret command and providence of God, but onely thoſe that had not the ſeal of God in their foreheads.</p>
               <p>And in the fifth verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And to them it was given that they ſhould not kill them, but that they ſhould be tormented five moneths, and their torment was as the torment of a ſcorpion when he ſtriketh a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now thoſe men which had not the ſeal of God in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, they were not to be killed by the locuſts that came out of the ſmoak of the pit,</p>
               <p>But they were to be hurt and ſtung by them, and this ſtinging ſhould torment them for five moneths.</p>
               <p>That is, for ſuch a time as their power did laſt.</p>
               <p>Now what the Spirit doth mean by five moneths as to time, it is uncertain, and not revealed.</p>
               <p>But as the torment is great unto that man that is ſtung with a natural ſcorpion in his body,</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the ſting that theſe locuſts did ſtrike thoſe men with who had not the ſeal of God in their foreheads, it was as the ſting of ſcorpions, and the torment was like unto it.</p>
               <p>Now this torment or ſting hath relation to the minde of man, as well as to the outward man;</p>
               <p>For the ſin of idolatry or falſe worſhip, eſpecially againſt a mans will, it will torment and ſting the ſoul of man, as the ſting of a ſcorpion doth the body, ſo that no reſt can be found;</p>
               <p>For when men are forced to worſhip contrary to the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, elſe they muſt looſe their eſtates; ſo that theſe locuſts they do either ſting men in taking away their eſtates, and afflicting them with outward trouble;</p>
               <p>Or elſe they muſt worſhip againſt the light of their conſcience, and ſo ſting their ſouls, and have the torment of his mind, which is as the torment of a ſcorpion when he ſtriketh a man.</p>
               <p>So that when men are tormented and ſtung in this manner both in ſoul and body, they will chuſe rather to die than to live, and ſhall ſeek for death, but it ſhall flee from them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things hath been experienced in all Ages by ſome, and will be to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Verſe the ſeventh, <hi>And the ſhapes of the Locuſts were like unto
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62818:57"/>
horſes prepared unto battel;</hi> And the latter part of the verſe, <hi>The faces of theſe locuſts were like men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe the eighth, <hi>They had hair like unto the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of a Lion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the nineth verſe, <hi>They had breaſt-plates of iron,</hi> And in the tenth verſe, <hi>And they had tails like unto ſcorpions, and there were ſtings in their tails, and their power was to hurt men five months.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe locuſts that came forth of the ſmoak of the pit, may be ſaid to be in ſhape like horſes prepared unto battel, in regard of their ſtrength and preparedneſs of minde, they had to hurt and to deſtroy; for the faces of the locuſts were like the faces of men.</p>
               <p>They muſt needs be like men, for they were men, onely they were wicked men, therefore called <hi>Locuſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their hair is ſaid to be like the hair of women, in regard they did wear their hair long, and their teeth may be ſaid to be like Lions teeth, in reſpect of the readineſs they had to tear in pieces with their teeth.</p>
               <p>And they may be ſaid to have breaſt-plates of iron, in that they were exceedingly well armed.</p>
               <p>Alſo they may be ſaid to have tails like Scorpions, becauſe of that poiſonous nature that lay in their tailes; for there was a ſting in it which did hurt men five months.</p>
               <p>Which men are called Scorpions, as that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> chap. 2. v. 6. he ſpeaking to the rebellious houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he calls <hi>bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thorns,</hi> as they were fit for nothing elſe but for the fire.</p>
               <p>Yet they like Scorpions did endeavor to ſting <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but he was incouraged of God not to be afraid of them.</p>
               <p>So that wicked men are <hi>Locuſts</hi> and <hi>Scorpions,</hi> and do ſting men about worſhip with perſecution, and death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And this ſting may be ſaid to be in their tails, when they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute men meerly for conſcience or religion ſake.</p>
               <p>Then is the ſting in their tails, and they do hurt men, as the Scorpion of the earth doth hurt when he ſtriketh a man.</p>
               <p>So that great Plagues were upon the earth, at the ſounding of the fifth Angel.</p>
               <p>Which Plagues did proceed from the ſmoak of the bottomleſs pit, it being opened by that king, who is the <hi>the Angel of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, whoſe name is called</hi> Appollion.</p>

               <p>And this angel of reaſon fallen from heaven unto this earth, is the Angel of the bottomleſs pit of the imagination of mans heart, which doth ſend forth that ſmoak, locuſts, and Scorpions, which doth ſting and hurt their fellow-creatures.</p>
               <p>Which doth bring ſuch Plagues and woe upon the inhabitants of the earth, which is far more then I can relate at the ſounding of the fifth Angel: But I ſhall leave the Reader to conſider of it, therefore I ſhall ſay no more of it here.</p>

               <p>But I ſhall proceed to the fourteenth verſe, <hi>The voice that came from the four horns of the golden Altar which is before God, ſaying to the ſixth Angel that had the Trumpet, Looſe the four Angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to underſtand, that theſe four Angels that were bound in the great river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> were not good Angels, but evil angels.</p>
               <p>That is, they were the Dragons angels, that is, they were four kings that were of the ſame ſeed and nature as he was.</p>
               <p>For they came from the old ſerpent the devil, which beguiled <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He may be called the old ſerpent, becauſe he was the firſt Angel that was thrown down from heaven unto this earth</p>
               <p>And where the ſpirit of this Serpent-angel is in King or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62818:58"/>
they being of his ſeed they may be called Angels alſo.</p>
               <p>For the devil and his angels are reſerved in chains of darkneſs, until the Judgement of the great day.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, the devil was that old ſerpent-angel that deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And he being an Angel of light before he was caſt down from heaven, but now he being upon this earth and diſſolving into ſeed, he is become an angel of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Why, becauſe he hath loſt the knowledge of himſelf, what he was himſelf, and what the other Angels were that were of the ſame nature of reaſon as he himſelf is.</p>
               <p>I ſay, he hath loſt the knowledge both of the form of Angels, and their natures, and what he was himſelf.</p>
               <p>So that he is now in chains of darkneſs, wondering in his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation what the devil ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Not thinking himſelf to be the devil, and this is ſpiritual chains of darkneſs, not to know what the devil is in his form and nature.</p>
               <p>And thoſe great men that came of his ſeed, that is, to ſay the ſeed of the ſerpent.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Cain</hi> the firſt-born of the devil, curſed <hi>Cham,</hi> ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> that Dragon <hi>Herod,</hi> with thouſands of other kings, and great men that are of his ſeed, therefore called <hi>angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that theſe angels are reſerved in chains of darkneſs, until the Judgement of the great day, as well as the devil their father.</p>
               <p>For they are as ignorant what the devil is, and that they are angels as the ſerpent is what he was before he was thrown down from heaven:</p>
               <p>So that I would have the Seed of Faith to know that there is no ſuch thing, as the ſeed of reaſon doth vainly imagine, as to think that there is any ſuch thing as a devil, and his angels in chains of darkneſs, out of the body of man, diſtinct from man.</p>
               <p>For there is no devil but man, and what is in the body of man.</p>
               <p>And this ſpirit of reaſon in man is the devil, and when the ſpirit of Reaſon hath got power in man, ſo as to be the chief and head of many people, he may be ſaid to be an Angel, though an Angel of darkneſs, becauſe he is in chains of darkneſs; for the ſpirit of Reaſon is in chains of darkneſs almoſt in all men.</p>
               <p>So that all men that are ignorant of the devil, and of themſelves, may be ſaid to be in chains of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:62818:58"/>And in this ſenſe all men that are ignorant of the true God, and of the right devil, may be ſaid to be the devils angels, and ſo the devil and his Angels may be ſaid to be reſerved in chains of darkneſs, unto the Judgement of the great day.</p>
               <p>This is onely to give the Seed of Faith a little to know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Angels.</p>
               <p>But theſe four Angels that were bound at the great river <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> were of the Heathen Kings that did ſucceed after <hi>Herod</hi> the Dragon, ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>And as for the great river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where theſe four Angels were bound; the meaning is this, theſe four Angels did border or inhabit near, and about this great River <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this River was in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and other nations did dwell, which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> did give to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to inhabit: but through their rebellion and idolatry, they were diſinherited, and the Gentiles had it again.</p>
               <p>And theſe four Angels did inhabit about that great River, for there was abundance of land that did belong to that great river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> whereby theſe four Angels could raiſe many thouſand horſes and horſemen, as doth afterwards appear.</p>
               <p>But why is it ſaid that theſe four Angels were bound?</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, they were bound by the ſecret providence of God, from going forth to battel to kill, and ſlay men.</p>
               <p>For they had prepared themſelves with ſuch a mighty Army, thinking to deſtroy and ſlay the third part of men, that ſhould come againſt them in an hour; if not in an hour, then in a day, if not in a day, then in a month; if not in a month, then in a year.</p>
               <p>So that theſe four Angels were prepared to accompliſh all this their deſign in a years time.</p>
               <p>But theſe four Angels were bound ſome certain time before they could do this.</p>
               <p>The time they were bound, it was ſo long as from the ſounding of the fifth Angel, to the ſounding of the ſixth Angel.</p>
               <p>For there was great Plagues at the ſounding of every Angel, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And now at the ſounding of the ſixth Angel, theſe four Angels that were, bound are looſed.</p>
               <p>And when they were looſed, you may ſee what effect they wrought.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62818:59"/>The meaning is this, when the ſixth Angel ſounded, there was leave given to thoſe four Angels that were bound before, the time being not come to go forth.</p>
               <p>Now they were looſed to ſlay the third part of men, as they would willingly have done before.</p>
               <p>And for that purpoſe they muſter up their Army, as in the 16 verſe, John <hi>ſaw the number of the Army of the horſemen, and they were two hundred thouſand thouſand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the 17 verſe, John <hi>ſaw the horſes in the viſion, and them that ſate en them, having breſt plates of fire and brimſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the heads of the horſes were as the heads of Lions, and out of their mouthes iſſued fire, and ſmoak, and brimſtone; by this great Army was the third part of men killed, as in the 18 verſe.</p>
               <p>That is, by the fire, and the ſmoak, and the brimſtone, that iſſued out of their mouthes.</p>
               <p>And as for their horſes heads, being like the heads of Lions, it was onely to ſignifie the ſtrength and dreadfulneſs of them.</p>
               <p>Becauſe men are more afraid of Lions, then they are of horſes: and as for the fire, ſmoak, and brimſtone, that iſſued out of the riders mouthes, it ſignifies a three-fold deſtruction of men.</p>
               <p>As thus, when a man is burnt with fire alone. Secondly, a man may be ſmothered with ſmoak, ſo that he die.</p>
               <p>And if a man be burnt with brimſtone, that is, a more terrible death then the other two.</p>
               <p>Now by one of theſe three was the third part of men killed, onely to ſignifie that ſome died a more cruel death then other ſome.</p>
               <p>That is, there iſſued out of their mouthes, a more cruel uſage or ſentence of death to ſome, then to others, ſo that they had a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold way to put them to death.</p>
               <p>But all of them iſſued out of their mouthes, onely to ſignifie that had a Commiſſion to kill three ſeveral ways.</p>

               <p>SO in the nineteenth verſe, <hi>For their power is in their mouth, and in their tayls, for their tayls were like unto ſerpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the power of this great army, to kill with fire, and ſmoak,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62818:59"/>
and brimſtone, it was in their mouth, and in their tails.</p>
               <p>That is, there iſſued out of their mouth fire, ſmoak, and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, that many men were killed of theſe three, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>But why is it ſaid, <hi>They had tails like ſerpents, and had heads, and with them they did hurt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They may be ſaid to have tails like ſerpents, becauſe the moſt wiſeſt and moſt moderate men in reaſon, were the hindmoſt part of the Army.</p>
               <p>And the moſt Lion-like men in the fore-front.</p>
               <p>So that the fore-front of men were ſo dreadful, their horſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo numerous and ſo pampered, that they ſeemed more like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heads of ſo many Lions rather then horſes, they were ſo dreadful.</p>
               <p>And the horſemen that ſate upon them came with ſuch fire, wrath, and vengeance, which iſſued out of their mouth, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like unto fire, ſmoak, and brimſtone.</p>
               <p>And theſe were in the fore-front of the Army, and did act as if they had been Lions, and as if there had been nothing elſe in their mouthes but fire, ſmoak, and brimſtone.</p>
               <p>But the tail or hinder part of the Army, did act more like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſerpents; for the tail of the Army had heads, and they had ſtings in their heads.</p>
               <p>That is, they had a Commiſſion to act like ſerpents, and to ſting and hurt men as the fore-front had which had breſt-plates of fire.</p>
               <p>So that the fourth part, or head of this great Army, were to act like Lions, and the tail or hinder part of this great Army, were to act like ſerpents.</p>
               <p>They having Commiſſion ſo to do from theſe four Angels, which were looſed by the great river <hi>Euphrates:</hi> and in this ſenſe it may be ſaid that the power was in the mouth; and in their tails.</p>
               <p>For whoſoever did eſcape the mouth or fore-front of fire, ſmoak, and brimſtone, they were ſure to be ſtung with the tail; for the tails had heads and ſtings in them.</p>
               <p>So that if the mouth of the Lions did not kill them, the heads of the ſerpents that were in the tails, would.</p>
               <p>So that what with the mouth, and what with the tails, the third part of men were killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:62818:60"/>For the ſting of Serpents lieth in the head, but the ſting of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions lieth in the tayl;</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that <hi>John</hi> doth ſay, the tayl of this Army were like unto ſerpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</p>
               <p>For take a ſerpent by the head and he can do no hurt, though his tayl be at liberty.</p>
               <p>But the heads of theſe ſerpents were at liberty, therefore it was they did hurt in killing of men.</p>
               <p>This is to be minded, that this great Army were heathen men, and thoſe upon whom theſe great Piagues fell were heathen men, wicked, idolatrous people, which worſhipped wood and ſtone guilded over with gold, even the works of their own hands.</p>
               <p>They make a god with their own hands, and fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Their idols are ſilver and gold, even the work of mens hands: they have mouthes and ſpeak not, eyes have they, and ſee not: noſes have they, and ſmell not: hands, and handle not: feet, but walk not, neither do they ſpeak thorow the throat,</hi> as that which hath life doth.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.15. <hi>The images of the heathen are ſilver and gold,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that theſe Plagues which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion, it was upon the Heathen Gentiles that had no faith in the Goſpel of Jeſus, neither did they repent ever the more of their idolatry and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of devils.</p>
               <p>That is, thoſe men that were not killed by thoſe Plagues, did not leave off worſhipping of devils, in that they did ſtill worſhip idols of ſilver, and of gold, and of braſs, and of ſtone, and of wood, which neither can hear, nor ſee, nor walk.</p>
               <p>So in the laſt verſe of this Chapter, as they did not repent of their wicked idolatry, neither did they repent of their other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſins which nature is addicted to.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, <hi>their murthers, nor of their ſorceries, nor of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, nor of their thefts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there needeth no further opening of the two laſt verſes of this Chapter, for they are eaſie to be underſtood; therefore I ſhall ſay no more as to the Interpretation of the ninth Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX.</head>
               <p>NOw I have given the Interpretation of all the chief things of Concernment in all the nine Chapters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>St. John,</hi> and I have ſhewed in ſome meaſure what Plagues and Judgements did proceed upon the ſounding of the Trumpet of every one of the ſix Angels.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſeventh Angel ſounding, it ſounds in the eleventh Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which Chapter I have interpreted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in that Treatiſe called <hi>The Interpretation of the Eleventh Chapter of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the chief things in the tenth Chapter, I have ſpoken of them in that Book alſo.</p>
               <p>Onely the ſeven Thunders what they did utter, I have not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concerning it.</p>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>John</hi> would have written what the ſeven thunders did utter, but the Angel forbad him to write, ſaying, <hi>Seal up thoſe things which the ſeven Thunders uttered, and write them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if he that heard them muſt not write what they uttered, how ſhould I that never heard them?</p>
               <p>So that I ſhall paſs by the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth Chapters, for I have ſpoken of the chief heads of the twelfth Chapter in the aforeſaid Treatiſe, and in <hi>The Divine Looking-Glaſs,</hi> ſo that I ſhall paſs on to the thirteenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>But before I come to interpret the thirteenth Chapter, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething concerning the ſeven Anti-Angels ſounding their trumpets, as the ſeven true Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> did.</p>
               <p>And how that there hath Plagues and Judgements been upon the earth at the ſounding of the Anti-Angels, as there was at the ſounding of thoſe Angels of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you may remember that I have ſhewed before, that the Miniſters and Paſtors of every Church are called <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the preaching of thoſe Miniſters and Paſtors, is the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the trumpet; ſo that when the trumpet of every Angel did ſound, there was ſome great Judgement did follow.</p>
               <p>As at the ſounding of the trumpet of the Roman Catholick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, when they did put Chriſt and the Apoſtles into worſhip, the Pope being made the firſt Biſhop or Miniſter, to ſucceed and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62818:61"/>
ſit in <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, and ſo other Miniſters were ordained under him:</p>
               <p>Was there not great troubles upon the earth at the firſt ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Popiſh Miniſtery after the Ten Perſecutions?</p>
               <p>The Hiſtories of <hi>England</hi> doth make mention what ſtrange things were acted upon the earth in thoſe parts at that time:</p>
               <p>But I ſhall leave that to thoſe that have been accuſtomed to read Hiſtories, who have thoſe Books to read.</p>
               <p>But in the time of its ſounding, hath there not bin many plagues and troubles upon the earth, upon people whoſe conſciences have been tender, and could not bow down to their idolatrous worſhip?</p>
               <p>Hath not the Popiſh Miniſtery invented ſtrange plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for them, as they did in the Ten Perſecutions? The Book of Martyrs doth relate many ſtrange torments, beſides what other Hiſtories do relate;</p>
               <p>Which the Papiſts did uſe to torment men and women that could not bow down to the ſuperſtition which the Miniſtery of the Pope did ſet up.</p>
               <p>So that it would be too tedious to relate what plagues hath bin upon the earth, what with the temporal and with the ſpiritual plagues at, and in the ſounding of the trumpet of the Popiſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,</p>
               <p>It being the firſt Anti-Angel of <hi>Europe,</hi> in reſemblance of the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Was there not great plagues upon the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, and turning the temporal affairs of the earth, when the Epiſcopal and Proteſtant Miniſtery did ſound, when <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and others did blow the trumpet of their Miniſtery, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and differing ſomething about matters of Religion?</p>
               <p>This I ſuppoſe moſt men have the Hiſtory to ſhew of that.</p>
               <p>And what wonderful things have been acted by Proteſtant Kings, and Proteſtant Miniſters, ſo that great plagues in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and perſecution for Conſcience for differing in Religion, hath been acted in the time of the Proteſtant Miniſtery?</p>
               <p>It being the ſecond Anti-Angel that did ſound, in reſemblance and likeneſs of the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Was there not great plagues at the ſounding of the Presbytery and Independent Miniſtery? I put them together,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62818:61"/>
becauſe they ſounded their trumpets both together, though there is a diſtinct difference between them in ſome particulars in point of Worſhip and Church Diſcipline:</p>
               <p>But they were both of them that which is called <hi>Puritans,</hi> and their Miniſtery did ſound a long time before they got power to perſecute; for they could not do that until they had put down the Epiſcopacy; neither could the Proteſtant Miniſtery perſecute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had turned out the Papiſt.</p>
               <p>So that the ſounding of one Angel did put down the other.</p>
               <p>And was there not plagues in the temporal, and perſecution in Religion, when the Presbyterian and Independent ſounded their Miniſtery? Was not the Biſhops put down, and the Presbyterian and Independent put in their room, or places?</p>
               <p>And did not the Presbytery perſecute for Conſcience ſake in matters of Religion? witneſs the Synod!</p>
               <p>And after that was down, the Presbyterian did perſecute upon the account of Religion, as many can witneſs at this day.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe was not the King driven from <hi>Whitehall</hi> by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians and Independents?</p>
               <p>Was not great Armies raiſed againſt him? was there not many men ſlain by both Armies?</p>
               <p>Were there not many thouſands of people undone and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe plagues and troubles at the ſounding of theſe two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Angels, namely, Presbytery and Independency?</p>
               <p>When I ſay Presbytery, the <hi>Scots</hi> are included.</p>
               <p>So that plagues doth follow upon the ſounding of the trumpets of theſe Anti-angels, as there did at the ſounding of the trumpets of the Angels of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Angel of the Presbyterian ſignifies and reſembles the Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Angel of the Independent doth ſignifie and reſemble the Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, Was there not great plagues at the founding of the Baptiſts, and the Angel of the Ranters? theſe two ſounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether alſo.</p>
               <p>That is, their Miniſtery ſounded forth together, as the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Independent did.</p>
               <p>And they held together in War as the other two. Did not

great plagues follow upon the ſounding of theſe two Anti-angels.</p>
               <p>Was not <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> upon the Baptiſts ſcore at the firſt? was not he made General? was not many Baptiſts and Ranters made great Officers of the Army? for the Levellers were of the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Fifth-monarchy men were of the Baptiſts.</p>
               <p>So that the Levellers were a Branch that ſprouted forth of the Ranters,</p>
               <p>And the Fifth-Monarchy men were a Branch that ſprouted forth of the Baptiſts.</p>
               <p>And were not theſe the men that overthrew the Kings Army, and the Scotch Army? Did not theſe beat down all thoſe that ſtood againſt them?</p>
               <p>Did not theſe cauſe Judgement to be given upon the King when they had overcome him? Did not theſe make <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> to bow, and fear before them?</p>
               <p>Was not <hi>Olivers</hi> name dreadful to Neighbor Nations? was not he a Terror to the Cavaliers? was there not great deſtruction in <hi>England,</hi> and elſe where, at the ſounding of theſe two Anti-angels? Theſe things many that are now living, can witneſs.</p>
               <p>So that there is plagues upon the earth at the ſounding of every Angel: for the Angel of the Baptiſt being the fifth, in reſembling the Angel of the Church in <hi>Sardis.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62818:62"/>Intimating the end of all time at the ſounding of the ſeventh Angel.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> hath involved the three Records in earth to agree in one.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, the Water, Blood, and Spirit; or the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law, and Commiſſion of the Goſpel, and Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Theſe three being ſeveral, and a great diſtance of time between every one of them, as they were acted upon this earth.</p>
               <p>Yet all but one record, ſo is it with the Revelation of <hi>John</hi> in his viſion, he hath joyned the ſounding of the ſeven trumpets of the ſeven Angels, as if they did relate to no other but to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When as the ſame ſpirit did ſound in the time of the Law, and ſo it doth now in theſe laſt days in the Commiſſion of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>For ſome of thoſe Plagues that were upon the earth at the ſounding of thoſe four Angels, they were acted in the time of the record of the Law, which ſignifies the water, yet ſeen in the viſion by <hi>John,</hi> as if they were all acted and performed by the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> were included in the viſion alſo.</p>
               <p>For there is a remnant of the ſeed of the woman, in all the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> that will be ſaved, though the Miniſtery of them be <hi>Anti.</hi>

               <p>And at the ſounding of theſe Anti-angels, great Plagues hath followed, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Quakers</hi> being the ſeventh and laſt Anti-angel, that will ſound in reſemblance of the Angel of <hi>Laodicea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There will fall great Plagues upon the earth at the ſounding, and in the ſounding of this ſeventh and laſt Anti-angel.</p>
               <p>For there is no more Angels to ſound after the <hi>Quakers</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, for this Miniſtery will laſt to the end of the world.</p>

that will ſound, and as the myſtery of God was finiſhed in the days of the voice of the ſeventh Angel when it did begin to ſound, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> the 10. and as I have declared in <hi>The Interpretation of the eleventh of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe when this Angel hath ſounded out-right, the world will be at an end, and the Kingdoms of this world will become our Lord Chriſts, and he ſhall raign for ever and ever, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15.</p>
               <p>And this Plague will be the greateſt Plague of all the other ſix Plagues unto the ſeed of reaſon, who have perſecuted the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and killed the juſt.</p>
               <p>But how long time it will be when theſe things ſhall come, it is not revealed to, me nor no man elſe.</p>
               <p>Onely this by revelation I know, that the laſt or third Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Spirit is now extant upon the earth.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Miniſtery, is the ſeventh and laſt Angel that will ſound.</p>
               <p>But how long time it will ſound, is not yet revealed to me.</p>
               <p>But this I know, that they are the laſt, and being the laſt, they may laſt a pretty while.</p>
               <p>Neither would I have the Reader to think, that the Miniſtery of the other ſix Angels will be extinguiſhed, for they will laſt to the end of the world alſo.</p>
               <p>Onely this I would have the Reader to underſtand, that all Sects and Opinions in matter of Religion, are compriſed in theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that theſe ſeven Churches are the root and body; and the other Opinions in religion, though ſeemingly they differ from them, yet I ſay they are but branches that are ſprouted forth from ſome of theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though they ſeem very great branches, yet they are but branches, as doubtleſs there was many differing opinions in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet all are compriſed by the Revelation and viſion of <hi>John,</hi> in the ſeven Angels Miniſtery of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So all Sects and Opinions are compriſed in the ſeven Anti-angels Miniſtery of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Quakers</hi> Miniſtery it being the ſeventh and laſt Anti-angel that will ſound the trumpet, in regard there will come, nor ariſe no higher, nor better things in matter of Religion, to the eye of reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62818:63"/>So that men and women which doth not know truth, when they want ſatisfaction in their mindes, they muſt fall into the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Plagues and Judgements upon the earth, are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the ſounding of the Trumpet of the ſeventh Angel of <hi>Aſia,</hi> it being no leſs Plague then the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Which Plague is far more greater then thoſe ſix Plagues which was at the other Angels ſounding;</p>
               <p>So likewiſe there will be greater Plagues upon the earth, at the ſounding of the Trumpet of the ſeventh and laſt Anti-angel, then there hath been at the ſounding of the other ſix Angels; for no more will come to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>And the nearer it grows to the end, the greater Plagues will be upon the earth.</p>
               <p>For is not almoſt all the world in an uproar, killing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying one another, ever ſince the ſeventh Anti-angel did begin to ſound?</p>
               <p>And yet greater Plagues then hath been, or is now, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue upon the ſounding of this Angel:</p>
               <p>But I ſhall leave it to what providence and time will bring forth, onely this to let the Reader ſee and know what a reſemblance there is between the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how that the ſeven Anti-angels were included in the viſion in the ſeven Angels of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and Plagues on the earth in like manner.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> in his viſion did ſee, that the end of the world would be at the ſounding the trumpet of the ſeventh Angel, the Anti-angel being included in the viſion, it will ſo come to paſs.</p>
               <p>But what day, hour, or year, is not known to any man.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall leave it unto God, who hath appointed an end in his own ſecret decree, and hath declared it by his ſervants the Prophets and Apoſtles; therefore ought to be believed by all that do expect eternal life, by Gods putting an end to this world.</p>
               <p>Neither can there be any ſatisfaction to the mind of man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be believed.</p>
               <p>It is that that ſatisfies me, ſo that I do not queſtion the thing, though the time when is uncertain; an end there will be, as certain, as there was a beginning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:62818:64"/>So I ſhall leave it unto God, that made a beginning of this world unto man, and according to his own appointment there will be an end.</p>
               <p>So that I need not ſay any more concerning the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> there being a likeneſs and reſemblance of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, unto the Miniſtery the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo may be called <hi>Seven Angels that ſounded their trumpets,</hi> and Plagues did, and doth fall upon the earth, at the ſounding of every one of the Anti-angels, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Now I have given the interpretation of the ſeven Anti-angels, I ſhall paſs by the 10, 11, and 12 chapters, as I ſaid before, and proceed to interpret the chief things of concernment in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter.</p>

               <p>IN the firſt verſe of the thirteenth chapter, <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſtood upon the ſand of the Sea, and ſaw a Beaſt riſe up out of the Sea, having ſeven heads, and ten horns, and upon his horns ten Crowns, and upon his heads the name of Blaſphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would not have the Reader to underſtand, that <hi>John</hi> did ſtand upon the ſand of the Sea with the feet of his body, when he ſaw this beaſt to ariſe out of the Sea:</p>
               <p>But the meaning is, the revelation of his ſpirit it was carried in the viſion by the revelation of Faith, as if he had ſtood upon the ſand of the Sea-ſhore;</p>
               <p>For the revelation of the ſpirit can ſtand upon the ſand, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea, though the body of a man be many miles diſtant from it.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe it is not to be underſtood, that this beaſt which he ſaw did ariſe out of the Sea: but, as I ſaid before in another caſe, this beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns, he did ariſe out of thoſe Iſlands which did border about the Sea, or lands that are environed about with the Sea, and other great rivers of waters, as ſome places of this earth is, as that of <hi>Jordan</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>Which thoſe that have travelled the earth and ſea, can better relate then I.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid that this beaſt did ariſe out of the Sea, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62818:64"/>
this borders, kingdomes, and people were environed or ſurrounded by the Sea, as the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was.</p>
               <p>So that except the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> had been dryed up by the power of God, there had been no entring into it by the people of the Jews.</p>
               <p>And ſo thoſe four Angels that were bound on the river <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> as I ſhewed before, ſo is it with this beaſt that <hi>John</hi> ſaw to ariſe out of the Sea.</p>
               <p>He may be ſaid to ariſe out of the Sea, for thoſe reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>This beaſt is ſaid <hi>to have ſeven heads and ten horns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is ſaid <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.2. <hi>That the great red Dragon had ſeven heads and ten horns alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference between theſe two is this, the Dragons ſeven heads and ten horns, is ſpoken with relation to ſeven Kings that ſhould proceed out of his loins, that ſhould have ten horns.</p>
               <p>That is, they ſhould exerciſe perſecution againſt the Saints ten times, in the time of the Apoſtles Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And this was the Dragons war that he made with the remnant of the womans ſeed, as in <hi>Revelation</hi> the 12, and the laſt verſe.</p>
               <p>And the ten horns that the Dragon had, were the Ten Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the Saints, which are called by the revelation of <hi>John ten horns,</hi> as is more opened in <hi>The Divine Looking-Glaſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the thing I would have the Reader to minde is this, the difference why the Dragon is ſaid to have ſeven heads and ten horns, and the beaſt that <hi>John</hi> ſaw to ariſe out of the Sea, he had ſeven heads and ten horns alſo.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, the Dragons ſeven heads did ſignifie ſeven Kings beſides himſelf, that ſhould exerciſe the ſame idolatry and perſecution of the Saints as he did.</p>
               <p>For he gave his power unto this beaſt, who had the ſeven heads and ten horns.</p>
               <p>But this beaſt that did ariſe out of the Sea, is ſaid to have ſeven heads and ten horns, in regard that he was one of the ſeven heads himſelf,</p>
               <p>And the firſt of the ſeven heads that the Dragon had.</p>
               <p>So that the Dragon is the eighth, and is gone into perdition, as I ſhall open more when I come to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:62818:65"/>Onely this that the Seed of Faith may ſee ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Dragons ſeven heads and ten horns, and the Beaſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads and ten horns.</p>
               <p>The one having ſeven heads beſides himſelf, and the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeven heads with himſelf.</p>
               <p>And as for the ten horns they were all one; for they were both blaſphemers and idolaters, and did worſhip idols and images, and perſecuted the ſeed of the woman, and make war with the Saints.</p>
               <p>And all the victory the Saints did obtain againſt the Dragon, the Beaſt, and their Image, it was by faith and patience in the blood of the Lamb; enabling them to ſuffer with patience thoſe Ten Perſecutions which thoſe ten horns did puſh the ſaints with thoſe cruel deaths, which the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>ten days tribulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more of that hereafter.</p>

               <p>BUt in the ſecond verſe of this chapter it is ſaid, <hi>And the beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a Leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lion, and the Dragon gave him his power, and his ſeat, and his authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would have the Seed of Faith to know, that theſe ten Perſecutions, which were the ten horns, they were acted upon the Saints, in the primitive time, ſo called.</p>
               <p>That is, ſo long as the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles did ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively laſt, or as long as the true Faith of Chriſt was upon the earth, which did laſt a matter of three hundred years, from the birth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For after his birth there was true Faith on the earth.</p>
               <p>For when <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> as he calls himſelf, <hi>did come in the fleſh upon earth, was there any faith upon earth?</hi> ſurely no.</p>
               <p>If there had been faith upon the earth, they would never have ſought to have deſtroyed him when he was born, as <hi>Herod</hi> that red Dragon did;</p>
               <p>And afterwards his own people the Jews.</p>
               <p>So that this is to be minded, that always when God doth come with his Commiſſions, there is little or no faith upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Was there any faith upon the earth, when God did ſend <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:62818:65"/>
to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to <hi>Iſrael? Moſes</hi> being the firſt man which God choſe, and gave a Commiſſion to write Scripture.</p>
               <p>I ſay, was there any faith upon the earth at the firſt appearing of God? Surely no.</p>
               <p>But after <hi>Moſes</hi> had appeared, then there was faith upon the earth, but at his firſt appearing there was no faith on the earth.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe at the ſecond appearing of God, that is to ſay when Chriſt was born, was there any faith upon the earth at that time, but onely in old <hi>Simeon</hi> and his wife, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> the ſuppoſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>The earth was very barren of true faith at the appearing of God, in this way.</p>
               <p>But after his appearing, there was much true Faith upon the earth, as may be read concerning Chriſt himſelf, that many believed on him, and a greater number of people believed on his Apoſtles, more then did on himſelf.</p>
               <p>So that there was great faith upon the earth, in the time of Gods appearing in his Commiſſion of the Blood.</p>
               <p>But before, or at the firſt appearing, there was very little or no faith upon the earth.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe at Gods third appearing in his Commiſſion of the Spirit, was there any true faith upon the earth? ſurely no.</p>
               <p>This I know by experience, that there was no true faith on the earth: but ſince God hath appeared in the Commiſſion of the Spirit, there is true faith upon the earth, more then hath been this thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred and fifty years.</p>
               <p>So that at the appearing of God in his three Commiſſions, there was very little or no true faith upon the earth, I mean at their firſt appearing.</p>
               <p>But after their appearing, there is true faith upon the earth, and that more abundant then at any other time.</p>
               <p>For that faith which is between Commiſſions, it is but a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faith, and not a ſaving and juſtifying faith.</p>
               <p>I onely give the Seed of Faith this bir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And afterwards the ſpirit and power of the Dragon, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted or ſeated upon this Beaſt, he being the firſt head which the Dragon did give all his power and authority, and his ſeat unto.</p>
               <p>That it, the ſame ſpirit of reaſon that was in <hi>Herod</hi> the Dragon, it was in the ſeed of this Beaſt.</p>
               <p>So that this B aſt having the ſame ſpirit of Reaſon in him, as the Dragon aforeſaid had, he did exerciſe the idolatry, blaſphemy, and perſecution of the Saints, as the Dragon did.</p>
               <p>So that he being of the ſame ſpirit and practice as the Dragon was, it may be ſaid that he received the Dragons ſeat, power, and authority.</p>
               <p>He being the firſt head that ſucceeded the Dragon;</p>
               <p>For this I would have the Seed of Faith to know, that this ſpirit of the Dragon, it went thorow the ſeed of all thoſe ſeven heads.</p>
               <p>And all that perſecution that was acted in that three hundred years in the time of the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles, it is reckoned all but unto ſeven heads, or ſeven beaſts, though more wicked kings then theſe ſeven might perſecute the Saints in thoſe Ten Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, in that three hundred years.</p>
               <p>Yet they are all included in thoſe ſeven, becauſe the ſame ſpirit of reaſon that was in the Dragon, the ſame was in the ſeven.</p>
               <p>And ſo in the ſeed of all wicked kings, ſo that they all acted as the Dragon did, in blaſpheming the living God, and perſecuting his Saints.</p>
               <p>For as all good Kings are included but into four good Beaſts, as I ſaid before,</p>
               <p>So likewiſe all wicked perſecuting Kings are included in thoſe ſeven heads, or ſeven wicked beaſts, they being of the ſame ſeed and nature as the Dragon is, and walk in the ſame ſteps of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, blaſphemy, and perſecution, as he did.</p>
               <p>They may be ſaid all of them to receive the ſeat, power, and authority of the Dragon, which is no other but the ſpirit of reaſon, whoſe original is from the fallen Angel, though called a Dragon,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62818:66"/>
a Serpent, a Devil, the ſeed of Reaſon is all this, and more.</p>
               <p>But little doth man think that the ſpirit of reaſon in every man, poor and rich, bond or free, high or low, King or people, is the devil, ſerpent, and dragon.</p>
               <p>For many poor men have the ſpirit of the Dragon in them, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have not power to execute it upon the Saints, nor his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures.</p>
               <p>Therefore when the Spirit doth call a man a Dragon, or a beaſt, it is with relation to that power that is inveſted upon, or in a King, or Head-Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>So that he being the head or chief above all others, he hath power and authority to do good or hurt.</p>
               <p>And according as his authority and power doth act it ſelf forth on this earth in righteouſneſs, juſtice, and worſhipping the true God,</p>
               <p>He is called by the Revelation of the Spirit, a good Beaſt, good King, or good Angel.</p>
               <p>So on the contrary, if the power and authority of the Head-Magiſtrate doth act it ſelf forth in unrighteouſneſs, and injuſtice, and idolatry, and perſecution for conſcience ſake, he is called by the ſpirit <hi>an evil Beaſt, a Serpent, a Devil, a Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that when the ſpirit or ſeed of Reaſon doth act in the Head-Magiſtrate like a Dragon, that King or Head-Magiſtrate may be ſaid to be a Dragon, as <hi>Herod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when a Head-Magiſtrate doth act as a ſubtile Serpent, he may be called <hi>a Serpent,</hi> as did thoſe Jews in Chriſts and the Apoſtles time.</p>
               <p>And when a Head-Magiſtrate doth act as a devil, he may be called a <hi>devil,</hi> as murdering <hi>Cain</hi> in point of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ip ſlew his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel,</hi> and ſo the Jews did by Chriſt in point of worſhip.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt calls thoſe Jews which were Head-Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as the high Prieſts and Levites, he calls them <hi>ſerpents, devils,</hi> ſaying, <hi>they were of their father the devil, for he was a murderer, and a liar from the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Cain</hi> was the firſt liar and murderer, and ſo the firſt devil in the ſtate of mortality.</p>
               <p>And thoſe Jews that would have killed Chriſt, were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Cain,</hi> therefore called <hi>devils,</hi> becauſe they did the ſame
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62818:67"/>
works as <hi>Cains</hi> their father had done. For they had perſecuted and killed Prophets and righteous men, and ſo they did Chriſt himſelf, as <hi>Peter</hi> doth relate in the Acts of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>So that they walked in the way of their father <hi>Cain,</hi> therefore called <hi>devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Onely this I would have the Reader to underſtand, that when the Spirit of Reaſon doth act in the Head-Magiſtrate, as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or as a devils, or as a Dragon, or any other way that the Scriptures doth brand for wickedneſs, it is all acted in this world, though <hi>John</hi> doth ſay he ſaw it in heaven.</p>
               <p>But it is by way of viſion, but the wickedneſs is acted in this earth; for the ſpirit of reaſon which is the devil, is become mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and ſo he exerciſes his cruelties and murthers upon mortals like himſelf.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid to be in heaven, becauſe the firſt original of reaſon came from heaven.</p>
               <p>The fallen angels nature being the ſpirit of reaſon fallen, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mortal, and ſo hath run thorow the ſeed of mortality, and ſo acts in the ſtate of mortality, as a ſerpent, devil, or dragon.</p>
               <p>And is ſaid by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> to be ſeen in heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpirit of reaſon, the devil, the original of it, came from heaven, but the things acted by it is acted in this earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>NOw the ſpirit of reaſon in this beaſt that did ariſe out of the ſea, to whom the Dragon gave his power, ſeat, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unto, he is ſaid <hi>to be like unto a leopard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now a leopards a ſpeckled or ſpotted creature.</p>
               <p>Now this beaſt is ſaid to be like unto a leopard, in regard of the policy which he did exerciſe to gain the people to fight for him and his image:</p>
               <p>For he ſeemed to the people to be very religious and zealous in worſhip, but it was to images of wood and ſtone.</p>
               <p>Yet this form of worſhip and command he gave to the people to worſhip the Image, they were as white ſpots of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And his threatning of thoſe that would not bow down to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Image, theſe were his black ſpots</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:62818:67"/>So that he in this regard may be ſaid to be like a leopard that is ſpotted black and white.</p>
               <p>Black to the Saints, but white to thoſe that received the mark of the beaſt in his right hand, or in his forehead: and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he may be ſaid <hi>to be like a leopard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He is ſaid <hi>to have feet as it were the feet of a Bear,</hi> that is, he acted as a Bear doth with his feet.</p>
               <p>That is, to claw and break the bones of that in pieces which he hath power over; for the ſtrength and miſchief of a Bear it lieth moſt in his feet.</p>
               <p>So was it with the beaſt, he by his Command to worſhip the Image which he did ſet up, claw and break the bones of thoſe Saints that would not fall down and worſhip the Image, by perſecution, impriſonment, and death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And in this regard he may be ſaid <hi>to have feet as it were the feet of a Bear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is ſaid, <hi>And his mouth was as the mouth of a Lyon:</hi> the meaning is this, he acted with his mouth as the mouth of a Lyon doth.</p>
               <p>That is, as the mouth of a Lyon doth roar with ſuch an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great and terrible noiſe, that the beaſts of the forreſts excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly fear and tremble at the noiſe of the Lyon that cometh out of his mouth;</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the roaring noiſe that came out of this beaſts mouth made all the Saints in <hi>Aſia</hi> at that time to fear and tremble:</p>
               <p>For there was gone out of this beaſts mouth great blaſphemy, as in the fifth verſe, <hi>And a Command went out of his mouth that they ſhould worſhip the Dragon, who gave his power, ſeat, and authority unto this beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in regard the Dragons power, ſeat, and authority was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eſtabliſhed upon this beaſt, there went a Command out of this beaſts mouth, that all people ſhould worſhip the beaſt, as they did the dragon, as in the fourth verſe of this chapter.</p>
               <p>So that the mouth of this beaſt may be ſaid <hi>to be like the mouth of a Lyon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe his Commands to worſhip devils, and blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the living God, proceeded out of the beaſts mouth, even as the floods of water did out of the dragons mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:62818:68"/>And in this regard the beaſt may be ſaid <hi>to have a mouth like the mouth of a Lyon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is to be obſerved, that this beaſt had <hi>one of his heads as it were wounded unto death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is to be minded, that it was <hi>but as it were,</hi> nor was thought unto death, but his head were not quite dead; if he had, he would have done no more miſchief to the Saints.</p>
               <p>But his deadly wound was healed, ſo that the world did the more wonder after him, ſaying, <hi>Who is like unto the beaſt? Who is able to make war with him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would have the Seed of Faith to minde who it was that did give this beaſt that deadly wound in his head, and yet was healed again.</p>
               <p>It was the faith and patience of the Saints that did give him this deadly wound, in that they would not worſhip the beaſt, nor his image, but did ſuffer perſecution unto the death joyfully.</p>
               <p>So that this beaſt was ſick with torment of ſoul, in that he could not bring them from the faith of Jeſus to worſhip devils, nor to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his will, ſo that he was wounded almoſt to death.</p>
               <p>So that he was weary of perſecuting the Saints, his Conſcience being ſo wounded he gave over perſecuting for a ſeaſon, until his Conſcience was healed again.</p>
               <p>And though it be ſaid, <hi>that he had a wound by a ſword, and did live,</hi> it was no other ſword but the Sword of the Spirit which was in the Saints.</p>
               <p>Even the faith of Jeſus which enabled them to ſuffer with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs the ſpoyling of their goods, and not loving their lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, rather than to worſhip the beaſt, or his image.</p>
               <p>And this was that deadly wound that the beaſt had in his head: and this was the firſt day, and one of the ten days tribulation the Saints did undergo.</p>
               <p>For when men ſuffer meerly for their faith of Jeſus, or in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of minde in matter of worſhip, they do by their ſufferings wound the perſecutors ſoules more, than if they ſhould turn again and fight with a ſword of ſteel.</p>
               <p>So that it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But after a ſeaſon his deadly wound was healed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62818:68"/>That is, after the plague of his heart was over, that he ſaw he ſhould not die.</p>
               <p>He grew more worſe, much like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the Plague from him and his people, his heart was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and made more cruel and worſe.</p>
               <p>So was it with this Beaſt, when his conſcience had the fear of the preſent death taken off him, ſo that he was healed as to that,</p>
               <p>Then he grew worſe then he was before.</p>
               <p>For now his mouth uttered blaſphemy, and power was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to continue forty two months, as in verſe the fifth.</p>
               <p>Theſe forty two months hath relation to the Ten Perſecutions, which did laſt a matter of three hundred years.</p>
               <p>For the ſpirit and power of this beaſt, did run thorow the loins of all them ſeven heads; they all being partakers of the Dragons power, ſeat, and authority.</p>
               <p>For it runs thorow the loins of al wicked Beaſts, or wicked Head-Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>For they have all the ſpirit of Reaſon, even the ſpirit of the Dragon, though not in ſuch a meaſure as the Dragon hath.</p>
               <p>So that the power of this beaſt ſhould continue in himſelf, and in others forty two months.</p>
               <p>That was all the days of the Ten Perſecutions, which time was the ſame, as the two Prophets did propheſie, which is ſaid to be forty two months.</p>
               <p>Which time was as long as the Apoſtles Commiſſion did laſt, about three hundred years, as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>So that you may ſee now this Beaſt was healed of his wound, he was worſe, and blaſphemed more againſt the living God, and againſt his Tabernacle;</p>
               <p>Which Tabernacle was the body of Chriſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now the Beaſt being recovered of that wound the Saints did give him, he comes on a freſh and makes war againſt them.</p>
               <p>Not onely in blaſpheming againſt the living God, or living Jeſus, whom the Saints did worſhip and ſerve, and would not worſhip, and ſerve him.</p>
               <p>Therefore he makes war with the Saints, and overcomes them.</p>
               <p>That is, cauſeth all thoſe he could light of, to deny their Faith in Jeſus, and worſhip as he would have them, or elſe they muſt be put to death; So that he did overcome many of the Saints, and put them to death;</p>
               <p>For power was given him over all kindreds, tongues, and nations.</p>
               <p>That is, he had power over all other people, but thoſe that worſhipped Jeſus,</p>
               <p>To command them to worſhip him, and that worſhip he did ſet up, and all people but the Saints did obey.</p>
               <p>Some for fear, and ſome for love, but all did obey to worſhip the beaſt, onely thoſe that had faith in Jeſus, therefore they were overcome and killed by this beaſt.</p>
               <p>But the others, the kindreds, tongues, &amp; nations ſaved their lives, for the world wandred after the beaſt, his power was ſo great.</p>
               <p>So that all that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him, <hi>whoſe names are not written in the book of Life of the Lamb, ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> as in the eighth verſe.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that the ſpirit of reaſon in this beaſt, and in all other beaſts, or Head-Magiſtrates that are of the ſeed of the ſerpent, ſhould have ſuch power over the dark reaſon of man, to worſhip him, and the image he doth ſet up.</p>
               <p>And the whole world lying in ignorance and darkneſs, they are thorow their ignorance ready and willing to worſhip any thing, that the ſpirit of Reaſon in the Head-Magiſtrate ſhall command them.</p>
               <p>And the ignorance and darkneſs of men in point of worſhip, is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62818:69"/>
ſo numerous, that hardly any can be ſeen in the world but idolaters.</p>
               <p>So that it may be ſaid, that all that dwell on the earth doth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the beaſt, none excepted but <hi>thoſe whoſe names are written in the book of Life,</hi> which are but few in compariſon.</p>
               <p>For the worſhippers of the true God, are but few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe that worſhip the devil.</p>
               <p>For the ſpirit of reaſon is the devil, and what image or form of worſhip is ſet up by the ſpirit of reaſon in the Head-Magiſtrate, having no Commiſſion from God, it is but of the devils ſetting up.</p>
               <p>And who ever doth bow down to worſhip in that manner and form, they do but worſhip the Beaſt and his image, and ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip devils.</p>
               <p>And is not the whole world at this day, as well as at that time, as well thoſe that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, as well as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Turks, and Pagans under that darkneſs of minde, as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip falſe gods, idols, and devils?</p>
               <p>So that the whole world may be ſaid to worſhip the beaſt and his image, though not all one kinde of image.</p>
               <p>For every Opinion of Religion in the world hath one image or other to worſhip, in ſtead of God.</p>
               <p>And it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the world doth not know the true God in his form and nature, therefore they worſhip devils in ſtead of God, though in divers forms and manner.</p>
               <p>But I would have the Seed of Faith to mind, that when I ſay all the world, the Elect Seed are excepted.</p>
               <p>For the Seed of Faith are not counted the world, though they be in the world.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them thou haſt given me out of the world, and that thou wouldeſt keep them from the evil of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Scriptures doth never count the Saints the world, though they be in the world. So that the Scriptures may ſay, that all the world wandred after the beaſt, for all the world doth wander after one falſe worſhip or other, but thoſe that have their names written in the book of Life.</p>
               <p>Now how ſhall a man know that his name is written in the book of Life, but in that he knoweth the true God, and how to worſhip the true God without any idolatry?</p>

               <p>By faith they know their names were written in the Book of Life, from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>That is, they are to look no further than the beginning of the world, that is, to the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> they being of his ſeed are not counted by the revelation of Faith, to be the world.</p>

               <p>So that the Seed of Faith are thoſe that died in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> yet their names were written in his Seed; and Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he being the quickening Spirit of that Seed.</p>
               <p>And as the Seed of Faith was dead in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame Seed is quickened again by the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <p>And ſo made alive again, and may be ſaid to be written in the Book of Life of the Lamb, ſlain from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid <hi>from the foundation of the world,</hi> with relation to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Abel</hi> being ſlain.</p>
               <p>So that who ever is of <hi>Adams</hi> ſeed, is of <hi>Abels</hi> ſeed; and who ever is of <hi>Abels</hi> ſeed, he may be ſaid <hi>to have his name written in the Book of Life of the Lamb, ſlain from the foundation of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Seed of Faith doth go no further to finde his name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of Life, than to righteous <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For who ever goeth further to finde his eternal Life, he will come ſhort of it, and never finde it.</p>
               <p>I give this hint to the Seed of Faith, onely to let them ſee where the Book of Life is, and where they may finde their names writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and not to go at rovers beyond the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>But go to the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of, and not as the imagination of Reaſon doth.</p>
               <p>For who ever goeth beyond <hi>Adam</hi> to finde his name written in the Book of Life, he will never finde it.</p>
               <p>So much for the interpretation of the eighth verſe.</p>

               <p>I Shall paſs by the two following verſes, there being nothing in them but what is commonly known; therefore in the next place I ſhall come to the eleventh verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>And I beheld another beaſt coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a Lamb, and he ſpake as a Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This beaſt is ſaid to come out of the earth, becauſe his power and dominion was moſt upon dry land.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſaid to come up out of the earth, as the other beaſt did ariſe out of the ſea.</p>
               <p>But this beaſt had the ſame ſpirit of reaſon in a high nature, as the other beaſt bad, and as the dragon had, and walked in the ſame ſteps, or worſe, than the other beaſt did, and exerciſed the ſame authority, or worſe than the dragon did.</p>
               <p>Yet he had two horns like a Lamb.</p>
               <p>That is, he did appear at his firſt coming into his Seat, more Lamb-like than the other beaſt whoſe deadly wound was healed, did.</p>
               <p>That is, he made a ſhew at his firſt appearance, as if he would have been more meek and merciful to the Saints that worſhipped Jeſus, than the other beaſt was.</p>
               <p>So that the Saints had ſome little hopes that he would have let them exerciſe their Worſhip, buy and ſell, and trade, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the mark of the beaſt in their foreheads, or in their hands.</p>
               <p>And it is very like they had ſome little ſpace of time at his firſt coming in, to worſhip, buy and ſell, and trade.</p>
               <p>For it is not to be underſtood, that the Saints were always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and put to death; if they had, they would have been all extirpated out of the world before three hundred years were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
               <p>So that there was ſometimes more liberty than at others, as there hath been in all Ages.</p>
               <p>So that the two horns of his power did ſeem to be like a Lamb, as if they would do but little hurt; for no man doth ſo much fear the horns of a Lamb, as they do the horns of a Bull: for the horns ſignifie Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62818:71"/>Now theſe two horns like a Lamb, they did ſignifie quietneſs in Religion, and peace in the Civil State.</p>
               <p>So that this beaſt appearing with two horns like a Lamb, it gave great hopes to the Saints that they ſhould have liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to worſhip Jeſus</p>
               <p>And peace in the natural or temporal State, to buy and ſell, and trade freely one with the other.</p>
               <p>As theſe two Powers did ſignifie the ſpiritual power, and the temporal power, they being the two horns like a Lamb.</p>
               <p>But this beaſt <hi>he ſpake as a Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the twelfth verſe, <hi>He exerciſeth all the power of the firſt beaſt before him, and cauſeth the earth, and them that dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what the power of the firſt beaſt was, I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>But in the thirteenth verſe, <hi>And he doth great wonders, ſo that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth, in the ſight of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe wonders that was done by this beaſt who had two horns like a Lamb, they were but counterfeit Wonders, and no real thing.</p>
               <p>For the imagination of man may do ſeemingly great things to the ſight of the dark minde of man.</p>
               <p>There may be wonderful ſtrange things produced by the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of reaſon.</p>
               <p>When the minde is exerciſed upon a Religious ſcore, they may do ſeeming Wonders and Miracles, as they do by their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a natural account.</p>
               <p>Did not the Magicians and Southſayers in <hi>Egypt</hi> by their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation do many ſeeming miracles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did?</p>
               <p>Did not they cauſe Frogs ſeemingly to appear before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did? and many other things as <hi>Moſes</hi> did?</p>
               <p>But this the Reader may underſtand, that the Frogs that <hi>Moſes</hi> brought upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they were real ſubſtances alive:</p>
               <p>But the Magicians Frogs which they brought up in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they were but ſhadows like Frogs, without ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>But the minde of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people being ignorant and dark, took the ſhadow for ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>But if mens mindes be not as dark as pitch, they may know that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62818:71"/>
the Egyptians miracles were nothing elſe but ſhadows preſented to the dark phantaſie of man, by the imagination of natural art and figure.</p>
               <p>For if the things the Magicians did before <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had been any thing but ſhadows,</p>
               <p>The people of the land, and the King would have been as much troubled to get away the Frogs, and other things that the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans brought upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> as they were with thoſe Frogs, and other things that <hi>Moſes</hi> brought upon <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be clear to thoſe that are not as dark as pitch, that all thoſe things which the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> did, were nothing elſe but ſhadows, meerly produced by natural magick; for when the thing was over, the ſhadow was vaniſhed alſo.</p>
               <p>So that the people heard, nor ſaw no more of the Magicians Frogs.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe when the imagination of reaſon is exerciſed upon a religious account, though it be in the way of idolatry, many ſtrange things may be atcheived and attained unto where the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of reaſon is religiouſly bent.</p>
               <p>For theſe two horns like a Lamb did ſignifie zeal in Religion, though in an idolatrous way.</p>
               <p>So that this beaſt being ſtudious of Religion, did by the ſtrength of his imagination, and his diabolical holineſs.</p>
               <p>He exerciſing his minde more upon idolatry and worſhipping of images, then the other beaſt did before him.</p>
               <p>So that this beaſt with two horns like a Lamb, could go further in his religious imagination, then the other beaſt did.</p>
               <p>And deceive the people more by a way of lying ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo that the people took this beaſt to be more god-like then the other; <hi>for this beaſt did ſeem to make fire come down from heaven on the earth, in the ſight of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He did this upon a religious account to deceive the people, as the Egyptians did upon a temporal account, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>That is, he went to imitate the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> to bring fire from heaven in the ſight of men, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, even as the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> did imitate <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this fire the beaſt brought from heaven, it was no real thing, but onely a ſhadow or likeneſs of fire, as the Egyptians was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62818:72"/>For this fire that he brought from heaven, it did no body no hurt, onely dazled the phantaſies of them that ſaw it with a ſhadow of fire, but no ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Even as the Egyptians did in the temporal.</p>
               <p>But the fire <hi>Elijah</hi> brought from heaven, it burnt up two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and their fifties, becauſe the fire that came from heaven it was a real ſubſtance, and did execution.</p>
               <p>But a ſhadow doth nothing but deceive the phantaſie of man for the preſent.</p>
               <p>As in the fourteenth verſe, <hi>And deceived them that dwelt on the earth, by the means of thoſe miracles which he had power to do in the ſight of the beaſt, ſaying to them that dwelt on the earth, that they ſhould make an image to the beaſt, which had a wound by a Sword, and did live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this 14 verſe he had power to command the people to make an image, and to dedicate it to the beaſt that received the wound with a Sword, and did live.</p>
               <p>And in the fifteenth verſe, he would ſhew another ſign or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that ſhould deceive the people more then the former ſign of bringing fire from heaven on the earth in the fight of men.</p>
               <p>So that he would deceive their dark underſtandings, for he had power to give life to the image of the beaſt, that the image of the beaſt ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe that as many as would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Image of the beaſt, ſhould be killed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>THis I would have the Reader to obſerve, that the Image that this beaſt with two horns like a Lamb, did cauſe to be made and ſet up, the Image was the ſame form and likeneſs, though made of wood or ſtone, as that beaſt was of that received a wound by a Sword, and did live.</p>
               <p>And that beaſt was a man, and the Image of that man did this beaſt cauſe to be ſet up to be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>For that beaſt with two horns like a Lamb, had power by his ſubtile and diabolical inchantments, to make this Image of the firſt beaſt to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>And by the ſpeech of the Image it ſhould cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the Image of the beaſt, that is, the form of this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62818:72"/>
Image of a man, ſhould be killed; now this ſeemeth very ſtrange to the minde of man, and ſo it did to thoſe people in that time, that the wiſdom of reaſon, the devil, ſhould by his witchcraft-power in point of Religion and worſhip, to make an Image which the work-man hath made with his own hands, for to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>It cannot chuſe but to cauſe ignorant, and dark-minded people to be deceived, and to fall down and worſhip it;</p>
               <p>They ſuppoſing that the Spirit of the holy Gods doth come into it, at, or in its ſeaſon, and ſpeak to the people, ſo that they are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, that it is the ſpirit of the holy Gods that ſpeaketh in it.</p>
               <p>So that they fall down and worſhip it, not thinking that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, power, and authority of the beaſt hath out-witted them; for the beaſt did make an Image of the other beaſt, aforeſaid, and did ſet it apart, or dedicated it of purpoſe for a God to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</p>
               <p>And made Prieſts overſeers of it, and conſecrated the Image by the Prieſts in a holy manner.</p>
               <p>And ſome boy or childe, had a way to go into the Image, and ſpeak in it ſuch words as the beaſt, and the prieſts ſhould order the childe to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>So that the childe muſt ſpeak thorow the mouth of the Image, as if the Image did ſpeak it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Juſt like unto a wooden puppet in a play.</p>
               <p>But as the Scriptures ſaith, <hi>none of their Images doth, nor can ſpeak thorow the throat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecreſie between the beaſt and the prieſts, might keep the thing ſo cloſe, that the people might know nothing but that the Image did ſpeak it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And ſo they being bewitched with ignorance, and darkneſs, and deceived by this policy, they do worſhip the Image.</p>
               <p>And ſo much the more, becauſe the Image did ſpeak, and the words that the Image did ſpeak, they muſt be ſuch words as he that gave order to make it, would have it ſpeak.</p>
               <p>That is, to worſhip the Image in the ſpiritual, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all people ſmall and great, bond and free, rich and poor, in the temporal to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads, as in the ſixteenth verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:62818:73"/>
                  <hi>So that no man might buy or ſell, ſave he that had the mark, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name,</hi> as in the 17. verſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the things that the Image muſt, and did ſpeak, and theſe were the miracles that this beaſt wrought in the eyes of the people, whereby they were deceived.</p>
               <p>For theſe ſeemed to be great miracles, and ſo they were, to that which knoweth not the true God, for great things may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the ſpirit of reaſon in man, if backed with the authority and power of the nation.</p>
               <p>But greater things then theſe have been acted in this nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſpiritual account, and more ſpiritual wonders and miracles have been wrought by the ſpirit of reaſon in <hi>John Robins, John Tancy,</hi> and others,</p>
               <p>For they have been able by that ſpiritual witchcraft-power, to preſent half Moons, Stars burning, ſhining lights to the fancy of people.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>John Robins</hi> hath preſented by his ſpiritual witchcraft-power the form of a Dragon, and the form of a ſerpent, and thick darkneſs, with divers other lying ſigns, and wonders.</p>
               <p>I call them lying ſigns, becauſe they were but ſhadows, and no real thing or ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Onely things produced out of the ſtrength of his own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it being ſtronger then others, it did ſubject the imaginations of others under it;</p>
               <p>And ſo they were deceived by it, their phantaſies being dazled, and over powered by his knowledge and wiſdom, in the dark power of reaſon, the devil.</p>
               <p>He could preſent to their dazled phantaſies, ſuch like ſhapes and ſigns, as aforementioned.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe it was in <hi>John Tancy</hi> his heart, to have offered up his ſon to a diabolical Diety, that he might attain to a greater and higher ſpiritual power, then he had yet attained unto.</p>
               <p>With other ſtrange things he did, and would have done, had not the Law of the Land been againſt ſuch things, to put them to death.</p>
               <p>He would have done much like <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.6. <hi>who made his ſon paſs thorow the fire:</hi> So that wonderful ſtrange things
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62818:73"/>
may be attained unto by the ſpirit of reaſon in man, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly about.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſpeak no more of theſe things here, onely theſe few lines are to let the Reader to ſee what ſtrange things hath been acted here in <hi>England,</hi> by men upon a religious account, and many more which I will not mention now.</p>

               <p>BUt I ſhall open a little what is meant by receiving <hi>the mark of the Beaſt in the right hand, or in the forehead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The mark of the beaſt is this, when a Head Magiſtrate or Chief Council in a Nation or Kingdom, ſhall ſet up by his or their power and authority, a Set-form of Worſhip, he or they having no Commiſſion from God ſo to do.</p>
               <p>And ſhall cauſe the people by their power and authority, both ſmall and great, bond and free, to worſhip after this maner of Worſhip that is ſet up by authority, as this beaſt did, elſe they ſhall be perſecuted or killed.</p>
               <p>This Form of Worſhip ſo ſet up without a Commiſſion from God, it may, and is called by the Spirit <hi>An Image,</hi> for all people to worſhip, by vertue of that Power that did ſet it up.</p>
               <p>For this I muſt ſay, that all manner of Forms of Worſhip which are ſet up by men who have no Commiſſion from God, they are but Idols and Images;</p>
               <p>And who ever doth worſhip God in thoſe Forms of Worſhip ſet up by Non commiſſionated men, they may be ſaid <hi>to receive the mark of the beaſt in the right hand, or in the forehead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there was alwayes in moſt parts of the earth one Supream Power in all Nations, that had power to ſet up Form of Worſhip, as an Image, and to command and compel all thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their power, to worſhip the Image ſet up by the Power, or by the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>For all Head-Magiſtrates are called <hi>Beaſts,</hi> as well as Kings, elſe the people have not been ſuffered to buy, nor ſell, but have been perſecuted and killed, even as they were at that time by the beaſt that had two horns like a Lamb.</p>
               <p>For whoſoever would not receive his mark, either in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62818:74"/>
or his right hand; that is, if they would not worſhip the Image ſet up by the beaſt, they ſhould be killed, or not ſuffered to buy nor ſell:</p>
               <p>That is, not to trade; which is as bad to ſome as death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>So hath it been ever ſince, and will be to the end of the world, little or much.</p>
               <p>For let the Reader conſider, how many have loſt their lives for not ſubmitting to the Worſhip, or as I may ſay Image, that hath been ſet up by the Papiſts!</p>
               <p>The multitude of people that Power hath ſlain and perſecuted upon that account, are hardly to be numbred by man.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Epiſcopal Power of Worſhip, hath for their Image perſecuted and put to death many.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Presbytery for their Worſhip, or Image, have perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and put to death many, witneſs <hi>New-England, Scotland,</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>The Independent alſo for his Worſhip, or Image, hath been guilty of perſecution.</p>
               <p>The Baptiſt they alſo have been guilty of perſecution for his Image or Worſhip, witneſs that one particular of <hi>James Naylor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that little Parliament that puniſhed him, were moſt of them Independents and Baptiſts; ſo that all men when they are in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fall to perſecution for Religion, if men differ from them in point of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>And as for the Ranter and Quaker they never were in power, ſo that their perſecuting ſpirits for Religion cannot be ſeen; yet all theſe ſeven Churches have an Image to worſhip.</p>
               <p>That is, they every one of them doth ſet up a ſeveral Form of Worſhip, but all falſe; for none of them knoweth the true God, neither hath any of them a Commiſſion from God to ſet up ſuch a Form of Worſhip as they do.</p>
               <p>So that all Forms of Worſhip in what manner ſoever, that are ſet up by Non-commiſſionated men, who are not authorized of God, their Forms are but Images or Idols, and the Worſhippers are Idolaters, and doth receive the mark of the beaſt, either in the forehead, or in the right hand.</p>
               <p>For the ſpirit of reaſon in man, is the Beaſt that ſets up Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as an Image, let it be in high, or low, but more eſpecially in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62818:74"/>
higher Powers, who have power to command people to worſhip his Image.</p>
               <p>And in ſo doing, they do receive the mark of the beaſt in their foreheads, or right hand.</p>
               <p>Now a man may be ſaid to receive the mark of the beaſt in his forehead, when as a man doth worſhip in that form and manner as is ſet up by the beaſts authority willingly, then doth a man receive the mark in his forehead. And when a man receives the mark of the beaſt in his right hand, it is when men doth worſhip, and bow down to that form of worſhip, or Image ſet up by the beaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a mans own mind or unwillingly, for fear he ſhall ſuffer if he do it not.</p>
               <p>This is to receive the mark of the Beaſt in his right hand.</p>
               <p>For if the mark of the Beaſt be not ſeen in the forehead, or in the right hand, they ſhall either be killed, or not ſuffered to trade.</p>
               <p>That is, to buy and ſell, one of theſe he muſt be ſure to ſuffer if he hath not the mark in either of thoſe two places, aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>That is, if the people doth not come to the publick worſhip ſet up by the Beaſt, either willingly or unwillingly, it was known that they had not received the mark of the Beaſt, neither in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, nor in the right hand.</p>
               <p>It is called the right hand, becauſe the right hand is that that ſubſcribes or writes his name to any thing of concernment.</p>
               <p>So that no man ſhould buy or ſell, ſave him that had the mark, or the name of the Beaſt, or the number of his name.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve, he that had the name of the Beaſt, or the number of his name, were thoſe men that were in offices and places in the Beaſts dominions, or that had a badge of the Beaſts arms upon them.</p>
               <p>For they knew the number of Beaſts which had ſucceeded even to the day or time of that beaſt, ſo that they knew the number of his name, and how many Beaſts were paſt before him.</p>
               <p>So that thoſe that had Commiſſions for offices and places of truſt, were thoſe that had the name of the Beaſt, becauſe they had the Beaſts hand to thoſe Commiſſions, for to authorize them in their places: and thoſe that had the number of his name, were thoſe that wore a badge of his arms, ſignifying what number of Kings loins this Beaſt did come thorow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62818:75"/>So that none but thoſe that had received the mark, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and thoſe that had the Beaſts warrants for Offices.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that had the number of his name, as aforeſaid, were to have the priviledge to buy and ſell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XL.</head>
               <p>VErſe the eighteenth, <hi>Here is wiſdom. Let him that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding count the number of the beaſt, for it is the number of a man, and his number is ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have the Reader to minde the interpretation of this verſe.</p>
               <p>Obſerve in the firſt verſe of this chapter, <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion a beaſt ariſe out of the ſea having ſeven heads.</p>
               <p>Which ſeven heads did ſignifie ſeven Kings or ſeven Beaſts, that ſhould have ten horns.</p>
               <p>Which ten horns did ſignifie the Ten Perſecutions, in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times ſo called;</p>
               <p>Yet we finde in this chapter but three of theſe Beaſts, which acted their parts in perſecuting the Saints, though all the ſeven heads did perſecute the Saints.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the laſt verſe of this chapter, <hi>John</hi> includes all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beaſts into one beaſt, ſaying, <hi>Let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt, for it is the number of a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt needs be the number of a man, becauſe man is called a beaſt, either a good beaſt or an evil beaſt, as I have ſaid before concerning the four good beaſts, they ſignified all good Kings and Head-Magiſtrates, were all included in thoſe four good Beaſts.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe all evil Kings and evil Magiſtrates, are included in thoſe ſeven heads, which the beaſt had that aroſe out of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Further, the Spirit of Revelation in <hi>John</hi> doth include all evil Kings and evil Magiſtrates into one evil beaſt.</p>
               <p>Shewing that there is but one evil beaſt, in whom the evil ſpirit doth raign in perſecuting men for conſcience ſake, becauſe they wil not worſhip the beaſts Image.</p>
               <p>So that you that can diſcern between the ſpirit of reaſon, and the Spirit of Faith.</p>
               <p>For theſe two Spirits lye both hid in their two Seeds, to wit,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62818:75"/>
the Spirit of Faith in the Seed of God, and the ſpirit of reaſon in the ſeed of the ſerpent-angel, or devil.</p>
               <p>And according as theſe two Spirits doth work, or operate in man, man comes to be a good beaſt, or an evil beaſt.</p>
               <p>So that who ever doth diſcern clearly between the two Seeds, may read, or count the number of the good Beaſt, and the number of the evil beaſt.</p>
               <p>For this I ſay, they are both but two men, that is to ſay, a good man, and an evil man.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the good Spirit runneth thorow the line of the Seed of Faith, and cauſeth good Kings and Head-Magiſtrates, and all others of that Seed to do well, and to worſhip God aright, as <hi>David</hi> did, and not to perſecute men for Conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>So on the contrary, the ſpirit of Reaſon, the devil, it runneth thorow the line of the ſeed of Reaſon, and cauſeth evil Kings, and evil Head-Magiſtrates, and others, to do injuſtice, and to worſhip a falſe God, and perſecute for Conſcience ſake, as king <hi>Ahab</hi> did.</p>
               <p>So that all good Kings and Head-Magiſtrates who have been guided by the Spirit of God, though many thouſands of them, they may be counted by the Spirit, but one good beaſt.</p>
               <p>Becauſe that one good Spirit of God did act in them while they were here in this world.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, though there have been many thouſand evil kings, and evil Head-Magiſtrates, yet they may be counted by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit but one evil beaſt.</p>
               <p>Becauſe that one evil ſpirit of Reaſon, the ſerpent devil, did act in them little or much whileſt they lived in this world.</p>
               <p>So that the one evil ſpirit acting in all the evil beaſts, they are counted by the Spirit of revelation, but the number of a man.</p>
               <p>Like unto that ſaying, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.17. <hi>And he meaſured the wall thereof an hundred forty and four cubits, according to the meaſure of a man, that is of the Angel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the bigneſs of the Angel was but as the bigneſs of a man: and thoſe hundred and forty and four cubits ſpoken of by <hi>John,</hi> it did amount in the concluſion but to the meaſure of a man.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe this beaſt, whoſe number is the number of a man, <hi>and his number is ſaid to be ſix hundred threeſc re and ſix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, as I ſaid before, the ſpirit of the Serpent-Angel hath
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62818:76"/>
run thorow the ſeed of Reaſon in ſo many Kings and Head-Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, who came from the loins of <hi>Cain,</hi> he being the firſt devil in fleſh, and the firſt man-devil.</p>
               <p>And his ſpirit running in that ſeed, it hath brought forth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evil beaſts, as ſix hundred ſixty ſix.</p>
               <p>Now I would have the Reader to underſtand, that <hi>John</hi> did not mean exactly ſo many, and no more; for doubtleſs there hath been many thouſands more ſince <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his brother <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I believe the revelation of <hi>John</hi> hath relation onely to thoſe evil beaſts which were in power in the time of the two Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that is, in the time of the worſhip of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How many evil Kings which are beaſts, were there in that time while that Worſhip ſtood, that perſecuted the Prophets, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the people to worſhip <hi>Baal</hi> and falſe gods?</p>
               <p>And ſo the Rulers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who were Head-Magiſtrates, who perſecuted the Apoſtles and Chriſt, theſe were of thoſe evil beaſts.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed by the Romanes, then their power and perſecution did ceaſe.</p>
               <p>And the Romane Gentiles, thoſe Emperors, and Kings, and Head-Magiſtrates, they perſecuted the Saints in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: and theſe beaſt afore-mentioned, were thoſe <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion.</p>
               <p>So that the number of theſe perſecuting evil beaſts who were idolaters, in the time of thoſe two Commiſſions, or two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I ſay they might amount to no more than ſix hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſix.</p>
               <p>Theſe all coming through the loins of <hi>Cain</hi> the firſt man devil, they may be called by the Spirit but one man, therefore ſaid <hi>to be the number of a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in the concluſion, all wicked, idolatrous, perſecuting Kings and Head Magiſtrates who proceeded from the loines of <hi>Cain,</hi> he being the firſt murtherer and liar from the beginning, they are counted by the Spirit in <hi>John</hi> but the number of a man.</p>
               <p>That is as much as to ſay, they are but one man, though ſix hundred ſixty and ſix men acted in perſecuting the Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Saints, yet all but the number of a man.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Chapter, and this Verſe in a few words, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62818:76"/>
the Reader may know what is meant by the mark, and by the name, and by the number of his name.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the mark of the beaſt in the forehead, is when a man doth worſhip the beaſt and his image willingly.</p>
               <p>And the mark in the right hand, is when a man doth worſhip the image for fear of looſing his goods, or fear of perſecution, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will.</p>
               <p>This is to receive the mark of the beaſt in his right hand.</p>
               <p>And he that hath the name of the beaſt, are ſuch men as have the beaſts warrants, or his hand to ſign their Commiſſions for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Truſt, or any other Offices in the State.</p>
               <p>This is the meaning of having the <hi>name of the beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thoſe men that have the number of his name, are ſuch as do wear a Badge or Figure of the Beaſts Arms.</p>
               <p>And this Figure or Badge doth diſtinguiſh thoſe men from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and not onely ſo, but it ſignifies the race how many kings or beaſts loins this beaſt came thorow, even to the number of ſix hundred ſixty and ſix.</p>
               <p>And this is the true Interpretation of the Beaſt, his mark, and name, and the true wiſdom of God, and true underſtanding of the number of the beaſt, and of this thirteenth Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLI.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt verſe of this fourteenth Chapter, <hi>John looked, and lo a Lamb ſtood on the Mount Sion, and with him an hundred, forty and four thouſand, having his Fathers Name written in their foreheads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Lamb that <hi>John</hi> ſaw ſtand on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> he was no other but God himſelf.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt is called <hi>The Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world:</hi> for who can take away the ſins of the world, but God? Alſo it is he that ſtood upon Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He may well be called <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> for he is God, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And that Mount <hi>Sion</hi> he ſtood upon, it did ſignifie the Faith of the Goſpel, according to that ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Believers in his time, <hi>You,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are not come unto Mount</hi> Sina, <hi>which genders to bondage: but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you are come unto Mount</hi> Sion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:62818:77"/>That is to ſay, the Worſhip of the Law that was given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> it was but Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> but the Faith and Worſhip of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel it was Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood upon Mount <hi>Sina</hi> by power from God to give the Law unto the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and this Law <hi>Moſes</hi> gave, it had power over the people to plague them if they did not obey, therefore called <hi>Mount Sina which gendred unto bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Moſes</hi> being choſen of God to give forth this firy Law, he may be ſaid <hi>to ſtand up n Mount Sina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe Jeſus the Lamb of God, he giving forth the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Goſpel, or Law of Faith, which is called <hi>A New Law,</hi> or <hi>Mount Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Chriſt being the Head that gave forth this Goſpel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, giving peace to all thoſe that doth truly believe, he may be ſaid <hi>to ſtand upon Mount Sion,</hi> even as <hi>Moſes ſtood upon Mount Sina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Jeſus the onely God, is that Lamb that <hi>John ſaw ſtood upon Mount Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Reader may ſee what is meant by the Lamb, and what is meant by Mount <hi>Sina</hi> and Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again it is ſaid, <hi>And with him an hundred forty and four thouſand, having their Fathers name written in their foreheads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve, this hundred and forty and four thouſand of Saints who were with the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> I declare they were all of the Jews Nation who were begotten by the Faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the Apoſtles Commiſſion, in relation or likeneſs to thoſe hundred forty and four thouſand that were begotten by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets Commiſſion of the Law, as is ſpoken of by <hi>John, Revel</hi> 7.4.</p>
               <p>Where he ſaith, <hi>And I heard the number of them that were ſealed, and there were ſealed an hundred forty and four thouſand of all the Tribes of the children of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This number here ſealed, were ſpoken with relation to thoſe of the twelve Tribes that were ſaved in the Commiſſion of the Law.</p>
               <p>And theſe of the ſame number in the fourteenth Chapter, were Jews of the ſame Tribes who were ſaved in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in the time thoſe two Commiſſions did laſt.</p>
               <p>But as for the Gentiles and other Nations, who believed and were ſaved in theſe two Commiſſions, they are not counted in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62818:77"/>
number of theſe hundred forty and four thouſand that were ſealed in their foreheads, or that hundred forty and four thouſand that ſtood with the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, they both had relation to the Jewiſh Nation onely, who were ſaved in the two Commiſſions, or two Teſtaments aforeſaid;</p>
               <p>But the Gentiles and all Nations that were ſaved in thoſe two Teſtaments, they were ſo great a number or multitude, which no man could number, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.9.</p>
               <p>Neither would I have the Reader to underſtand, that the Spirit in <hi>John</hi> did mean exactly ſuch a number of the Jews, and no more.</p>
               <p>But if his revelation led him out to ſpeak of ſuch a number, or to include many thouſands more in ſuch a ſmall number, who ſhall gainſay it?</p>
               <p>But happy will thoſe be that know themſelves to be one of the ſaved of the Lord, though they be none of thoſe hundred forty and four thouſand ſpoken of, who ſtood upon Mount <hi>Sion</hi> with the Lamb.</p>
               <p>So much for the Interpretation of the firſt Verſe.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Verſe, <hi>John heard a voice from Heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder, and he heard the voice of Harpers harping with their Harps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder which <hi>John</hi> heard from heaven,</p>
               <p>I declare it was that Praiſe, Halelujah, and Melody that thoſe hundred forty and four thouſand which ſtood with the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> did ſing, they all harping with their Harps, it made a noiſe as the ſound of many waters, or as the voice of a great thunder.</p>
               <p>For I ſay the voice of ſuch a great number of Saints ſinging Praiſe to the Lamb together, it would make a great ſound, even as the ſound of many waters.</p>
               <p>For many waters will make a great roaring, that people that have travelled can tell.</p>
               <p>And as for thunder, that dreadful noiſe moſt people can expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: and ſuch a great noiſe or voice do the Saints make when they play upon the harps of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Which Harps, what they are, I have opened what is meant by them before, therefore I ſhall ſpaek no more of them here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:62818:78"/>And in the third Verſe, <hi>And they ſung as it were a new Song be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne, and before the four Beaſt, and the Elders, and no man could learn that Song but the hundred forty four thouſand which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This new Song was that ſound of many waters, and the voice of a great thunder which thoſe Harps did ſound forth; which Harps were the tongues of thoſe hundred forty four thouſand Saints, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Who ſung the new Song, that is, the Song of the Lamb, that is, the Song of the Goſpel of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And the other hundred forty and four thouſand in the ſeventh Chapter, they ſung the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, the Song of the Law.</p>
               <p>Now there is no man that could learn, or ſing this new Song of Praiſe unto the Lamb, nor the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but thoſe that were redeemed from the earth.</p>
               <p>Now the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Song of the Lamb, what they are I have opened before.</p>
               <p>Alſo what the Harps are I have ſhewed before, ſo that I need ſay no more of it here.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And in the fifth Verſe there is ſaid, <hi>In their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault before the Throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve that thoſe hundred forty four thouſand Saints they are ſaid not to be defiled with women, for they are virgins.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, they were not defiled in their ſouls with idolatry, in worſhipping of idols and falſe gods;</p>

               <p>And as for their being Virgins, the meaning is this, they were

               <p>For the believing Gentiles are not called the firſt fruits unto God, becauſe God choſe the Jews Church firſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore the believing Jews are called by the Spirit in <hi>John, the firſt fruits unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe being preſerved in their ſpirits from defiling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with idols, they are ſaid <hi>in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault before the Throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, they were not guilty of worſhipping of falſe gods, and ſo not defiled with women: but worſhipped Chriſt in the way as he gave his Apoſtles to eſtabliſh, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And in the ſixth verſe, <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion <hi>another Angel flie in the midſt of heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Angel <hi>John</hi> ſaw flie in the midſt of heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach, I declare it was <hi>Peter,</hi> he being the Head-Apoſtle to whom Chriſt committed the preaching of the Goſpel unto, and to whom Chriſt committed the keyes of heaven, and of hell: and upon <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, Chriſt called <hi>A Rock,</hi> upon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62818:79"/>
which he would build his Church. Alſo I would have the Reader to minde, that Chriſt gave this power to all the twelve Apoſtles as well as to <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For they all had their Commiſſion from Chriſt after he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, to preach the everlaſting Goſpel to all Nations that dwell upon the earth, according to that ſaying of Chriſt to his Apoſtles before he ſuffered death.</p>
               <p>Who ſaid unto his Apoſtles whom he had choſe, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every creature, or to all nations, and lo I will be with you to the end of the world, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Goſpel was preached to all nations, according to the words of Chriſt in the time of the Apoſtles Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>As may be read, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.5. <hi>And there dwelling at Jeruſalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto theſe Jews did <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, preach the Goſpel of Jeſus, they ſpeaking, though unlearned men, to every man in his own tongue, the wonderful things of God.</p>
               <p>So that this Goſpel which the Apoſtles preached, it was carried to all Nations on the earth, as you may read <hi>Acts</hi> 2. beginning at the ſeventh verſe.</p>
               <p>And as for the everlaſting Goſpel being preached to every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and kinred, and tongue, and people, it was preached at that time aforeſaid, and at other times.</p>
               <p>For Jew and Gentile doth include all nations, kinred, tongues, and people.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> being choſen of Chriſt to preach the everlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel unto the Gentiles, he was made one with the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the Commiſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Peter</hi> he being the Apoſtle of the Jews, and <hi>Paul</hi> being the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, they both preaching one everlaſting Goſpel, ſo counted by the Spirit in <hi>John</hi> but one Angel flying in the midſt of heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach.</p>
               <p>Therefore minde, though there were Apoſtles beſides <hi>Paul,</hi> and divers other Preachers of the Goſpel in the time of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which did laſt a matter of three hundred years, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, yet they are all called by the revelation in <hi>John,</hi> but one Angel, becauſe they were all under one Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> being the chief and head Apoſtle of the Commiſsion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62818:79"/>
of the Goſpel, I declare by revelation that he is called by <hi>John</hi> that Angel that he ſaw flie in the midſt of heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach.</p>
               <p>And this everlaſting Goſpel which was preached, it was Chriſt crucified unto death, and Chriſt riſen again, and aſcended up into glory in that ſame body he ſuffered death in.</p>
               <p>And this was that Goſpel the Angel did preach unto them that dwell on the earth.</p>
               <p>This is alſo the everlaſting Goſpel which is preached to every nation, kinred, tongue, and people.</p>
               <p>And according to the words of Chriſt when he was upon earth to his Apoſtles, the Goſpel was preached to every nation on the earth by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ordained by them, and Chriſt was with them to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>That was to the end of their Commiſsion, which did laſt as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, a matter of three hundred years.</p>
               <p>So that you whoſe underſtandings are enlightned in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of revelation and interpretation of Scripture, you may ſee what is meant by the Angel who had the everlaſting Goſpel to preach, and what the Goſpel is, and when it was preached.</p>
               <p>And to whom, and how Chriſt was with the preachers of it to the end of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XLIII.</head>
               <p>I Shall paſs by the ſeventh Verſe, there being no matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in it, but what is commonly known by all, who will confeſs they ought to fear God, and praiſe him that created or made the heavens, and the earth, and the ſea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the eighth Verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And there followed another Angel, ſaying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great City, becauſe ſhe made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You that have the true light of Life in you, obſerve what this <hi>Babylon</hi> is that <hi>John</hi> propheſies of, or that he ſaw in his viſion is fallen, is fallen, that great City.</p>
               <p>Now what the Angel was that ſaid ſo, or ſhewed it to <hi>John,</hi> I ſhall not ſpeak of here, being of no great concernment to know.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:62818:80"/>But the great matter to know is, what is meant by this <hi>Babylon</hi> that is fallen, and what is meant by the great City, and the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
               <p>I would have the Reader obſerve, that there is a two-fold <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> the one in the Hiſtory, and the other in the myſtery; that is, one is a temporal, and the other a ſpiritual <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is with relation to the Nation of the Jews, who were carried captive unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there to remaine the ſpace of threeſcore and ten years captive in <hi>Babylon,</hi> before the fall of it, according to the propheſie of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and others of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as you may ſee <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> 25 11. concerning the Nations of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſerving the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſeventy years.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the down-fall of that temporal <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 25.12, 13. concerning Gods puniſhing <hi>Babylon</hi> when thoſe ſeventy years were accompliſhed, and the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and will make it a perpetual deſolation.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Babylon</hi> here ſpoken of by the prophets, it was that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral <hi>Babylon</hi> which the prophets ſaw would fall, and ſo it did when the time was accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Babylon John</hi> ſpeaks of that is fallen, it is that ſpiritual myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> that is fallen.</p>
               <p>He ſpeaking with relation to the end of the world; For <hi>John</hi> did ſee by faith the end of the world to be as certain, as the prophets did ſee by faith the down-fall of that temporal <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo it is to be minded, that this myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Revelation.</hi> 17.5. where is ſaid, <hi>And upon her head was a name written, Myſtery, Babylon the great, the Mother of harlots, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Babylon</hi> in the 14th chapter which <hi>John</hi> ſaith is fallen, is that myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> that is fallen in faiths account, as the temporal <hi>Babylon</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Now this Hiſtory or temporal <hi>Babylon,</hi> it was appointed of God to puniſh the nation of the Jews for their idolatry.</p>
               <p>That is, they being ſo ſubject to it, when as they had a Law of Worſhip given them of God by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that God gave them into the hands of the king of <hi>Babylon</hi> for a time, that they might ſee the extream abominations of the the Heathen, and how far they did exceed in idols in worſhipping
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62818:80"/>
of falſe gods beyond the Iſraelites; ſo that the Iſraelites might drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
               <p>That is, that the Nation of the Jews might be drunken with the worſhipping of Idols, even as men are drunken with wine, and commit fornication in their ſpirits with the Idols and worſhip of <hi>Babylon,</hi> even as men commit fornication with women with their bodies, till they have hardly any ſtrength of nature left in them.</p>
               <p>So that this ſpirtual Idolatry and fornication in the mind with Idols and falſe worſhip, it becomes the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
               <p>That is, when wine, the ſtrength of it, hath the upper hand in mans brain, ſo that he hath loſt his ſenſes, that man may be ſaid to have the wrath of the wine in him.</p>
               <p>And if the wrath of the wine ſhould alwayes continue, that man would be fit for no buſineſs in this world at all, neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he all the while the wrath or ſtrength of the wine doth remain upon him.</p>
               <p>So is it in the ſpiritual, who ever doth worſhip Idols and falſe gods, let it be in what forms or maner ſoever, they may be ſaid to drink the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
               <p>Neither are thoſe idolatrous people who are drunk with idols and falſe worſhip, ſit for any ſervice in the worſhip of the true God, untill the ſtrength of that falſe worſhip be wrought out of the people.</p>
               <p>For they be as drunk with ſpiritual fornication and falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as men are with wine and fornication in the natural, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
               <p>Obſerve! You may remember that I have ſaid before, that there is two <hi>Babylons</hi> ſpoken of in Scriptures, a hiſtory or temporal <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a myſtery, or ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> and both theſe <hi>Babylons</hi> in faiths account are fallen.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks it twice over, becauſe there is two <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons,</hi> yet both included into one, becauſe the ſpiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> is the laſt that is to fall, yet by the eye of faith he ſaw it is fallen.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſaith he, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Babylon</hi> where the Jews were carried captive, it was a great Citty, and many nations were drunk with the wine of her idolatrous fornication and worſhip, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:62818:81"/>Onely this is to be minded, that this <hi>Babylon</hi> in the temporal, it was appointed for the puniſhment of the Nation of the Jews, they being the choſen people of God to worſhip him, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this temporal <hi>Babylon</hi> it did belong only to thoſe people that were under the Commiſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prophets, to be a puniſhment to them for their diſobedience unto the worſhip of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the prophets.</p>
               <p>For the prophets all complain of <hi>Iſraels</hi> declining and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the worſhip of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>Babylon John</hi> ſpeaks of here in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it is that ſpiritual and myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> that is fallen.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> it doth belong to the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, and what worſhip was ſet up by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, was to be obeyed at the time of their Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>But there was another form of Worſhip ſet up by thoſe beaſts aforeſaid, who were Kings in great power, who commanded all nations to worſhip thoſe idols and images that were ſet up by them.</p>
               <p>So that all nations were made to drink the wine of this ſpiritual <hi>Babylons</hi> fornication, as they were of the other aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Mind: it is called <hi>ſpiritual Babylon,</hi> becauſe the worſhip ſet up by the aforeſaid beaſts, it was in opoſition to the worſhip of the Goſpel, the Goſpel-worſhip being more ſpiritual, then the worſhip of the Law.</p>
               <p>And as the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> did defie the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their Worſhip of the Law, ſo did theſe beaſts in the Commiſſion of the Goſpel, defie the living Jeſus, and the Worſhip ſet up by his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And in this regard, this <hi>Babylon John</hi> ſpeaketh of, may be ſaid <hi>to be a ſpiritual Babylon, who made all the nations of the earth to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as certain as the other <hi>Babylon</hi> was deſtroyed with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual deſtruction, when the ſeventy years was accompliſhed,</p>
               <p>So will this <hi>Babylon</hi> aforeſaid, be deſtroyed with an eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, when the time apointed of God is accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>And as the Jews nation were under <hi>Babylons</hi> yoke, ſo were the Saints in the primitive time, or in the Commiſſion of the Goſpel under the yoke of perſecution of this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62818:81"/>And this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> who made all nations drunk with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fornication, in worſhipping of Idols, and Images as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, is that great City <hi>Babylon:</hi> is called <hi>a great City,</hi> becauſe ſhe made all nations to become idolatrous.</p>
               <p>For when a man doth bow down and ſubmit to worſhip any idol, Image, or form of worſhip that is falſe, it not being ſet up by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, he may be ſaid to drink of the cup of ſpiritual fornication.</p>
               <p>More might be ſaid of this thing, but I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of it hereafter; onely this is to be minded here, that the Saints in all this time of the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles, did not drink of the cup of fornication.</p>
               <p>That is, they were not polluted with worſhipping of idols and images, or any falſe worſhip, but did cleave cloſe to the faith and worſhip of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I mean thoſe that did truly believe the Apoſtles doctrine, and thoſe that were converted by it in the time of their Commiſſion, their Worſhip differing in every thing from the worſhip of the whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even as the worſhip of the Jews did differ from that great City, the whore of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>This is the true interpretation of the great City, the ſpiritual <hi>Babylon, who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As you may ſee in the ninth verſe, <hi>And the third Angel followed them, ſaying with a loud voice, If any man worſhip his Image, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</hi> in the tenth verſe, <hi>the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that none of the Saints after they truely believed, did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Beaſt, nor his Image, nor practice that manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that was ſet up by the power of the beaſt.</p>
               <p>Neither did they receive his mark, neither in their foreheads, nor right hands.</p>
               <p>That is, they did not ſubmit to his worſhip neither willingly nor unwillingly, ſo that the Saints did not drink of the wine of her fornication at all, in that they did not worſhip any idols, images, or forms of falſe worſhip which was ſet up by this great City, the ſpiritual whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:62818:82"/>Whoſe torment is expreſſed in the verſes following, both ſhe, and all thoſe that drunk of her cup of fornication, and received the mark.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall paſs by thoſe verſes which ſpeaketh of that, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſayings hereafter that ſpeaks much of the torments of the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thoſe ſhe committed whoredom with.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall paſs by that, and two verſes more, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little matter in them, but what is commonly known by all, ſo I ſhall proceed to the fourteenth verſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANd I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one ſate like unto the Son of Man, having on his head a golden Crown, and in his hand a ſharp ſicle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Son of Man <hi>John</hi> ſaw ſit upon the white cloud, I declare it was no other but Chriſt the onely God, though ſaid by <hi>John</hi> to like unto the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>He may well be ſaid to be like unto the Son of Man, becauſe he be is the Son of Man, for he called himſelf ſo.</p>
               <p>For ſaith he, when he was on earth, the Son of Man muſt be betrayed into the hands of ſinners, meaning himſelf.</p>
               <p>And other places in Scripture, where he calls himſelf the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>Now to know why Chriſt called himſelf the Son of Man, he being the Son of God, nay God himſelf, it will be worth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding of this myſtery.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, he calls himſelf the Son of Man, becauſe he took upon him the nature of Man, in the womb of <hi>Mary</hi> the virgin.</p>
               <p>That is, he gained the Godhead nature, and Manhood toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the womb of <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin, and there cloathed the Godhead nature with pure humane fleſh.</p>
               <p>So that he, when he was born into this world, was perfect God and Man, according to that ſaying <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the nineth, <hi>To us a childe is born, to us a Son is given, he ſhall be called the mighty God, the everlaſting Father,</hi> with other titles of the divine Godhead, yet a childe, a perfect man childe, born of a Virgin.</p>
               <p>And ſhe conceived in her womb by the Holy Ghoſt, that is, by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62818:82"/>
the holy God, ſo the Virgin ſhe being the Mother that bare Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and brought him forth into this world, as other children are brought forth into this world.</p>
               <p>In this regard he did call himſelf, and is called by the Spirit, the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>For he taking the nature of Man upon him, and being born of a Virgin, he may call himſelf the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>That is, he is the Son of Man but by the Mothers ſide, but not by the Fathers ſide.</p>
               <p>For by the Fathers ſide, he called himſelf the Son of God, and ſo he was, yea, he was God himſelf.</p>
               <p>The parrallel is much like unto <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> they were both bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the mothers ſide, but not by the father;</p>
               <p>For they had two ſeveral fathers: <hi>Adam</hi> was the father of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Abel,</hi> and the ſerpent-angel was the father of curſed <hi>Cain,</hi> as the Scripture doth plainly prove, if underſtood by the Reader.</p>
               <p>For it is not written no where in Scripture, that <hi>Adam</hi> begot <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding <hi>Eve</hi> was the mother of them both, and ſo <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were brothers by the Mothers ſide, but not by the Fathers ſide.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe Chriſt was the Son of God, nay God himſelf by the Fathers ſide, but by the Mothers ſide he was the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe he called himſelf <hi>The Son of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Son of Man is that Son of Man <hi>John</hi> looked and ſaw <hi>ſit upon a white cloud, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a ſharp ſicle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This cloud he ſate upon, it was that cloud the Apoſtles ſpeaks of, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. <hi>Wherefore ſeeing we alſo are encompaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what this cloud is, it is expreſſed in the eleventh chapter, concerning the faith of the Patriarchs and Prophets, and Saints, who had the righteouſneſs of faith in them, beginning at righteous <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Joſeph, Moſes, David, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and the Prophets, with other Saints who ſuffered wonderful ſtrange deaths for their Faith.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and many more were that cloud the Son of Man ſate upon, they all expecting by faith Gods coming in fleſh, they being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:62818:83"/>That is, their faith in them was ſatisfied that he would come, though it was many hundred years after they were dead; the apoſtles and ſaints afterwards were witneſſes that the Son of Man was riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p>So that their faith was a cloud of witneſſes alſo, and the faith of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Prophets, Apoſtles and Saints, it was that cloud the Son of Man did ſit upon.</p>
               <p>It is called <hi>a white cloud</hi> by the Spirit, becauſe they were never defiled with the fornication of Idols.</p>
               <p>But worſhipped the true God according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and according to the faith of Jeſus, or the Goſpel, they not receiving the mark of the beaſt, neither in the forehead, nor in the hand.</p>
               <p>That is, they were not defiled with worſhipping of any Images, Idols or falſe gods whatſoever, and in this regard they may be called <hi>A white cloud:</hi> and this is that white cloud the Son of Man, even Jeſus the onely God, doth ſit upon.</p>
               <p>As the whore in another caſe is ſaid to ſit upon many waters, which I ſhall have an occaſion to ſpeak of when I come to it.</p>
               <p>And as for that golden Crown that was upon his head, I declare it was that honor and glory which the Prophets, Apoſtles and Saints do attribute unto him, as he is a Redeemer.</p>
               <p>The work of redemption being wrought by him as he was a man, he being in the form of a ſervant, ſo that all the redeemed ones who are ſenſible of their redemption, they do praiſe and magnifie the man Jeſus, the only God, for his great love towards them, in that they had faith to receive the benefit of his death.</p>
               <p>And this honor, glory, and praiſe which is attributed unto the man Jeſus, by his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Saints, is that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Crown upon his head, and in his hand a ſharp ſicle.</p>
               <p>Now this ſharp ſicle in his hand, it ſignfies his great power, that when the end of the world ſhall be, that he will ſend his Angels to reap the world, even as Reapers doth corn when the harveſt is ripe.</p>
               <p>So when the worlds ſins are ripe, the harveſt will be; and much like unto a maſter of the harveſt of Corn, he will thruſt in his ſicle firſt, then all his ſervants, until the harveſt is reaped.</p>
               <p>So is it with him that ſate under the white cloud, when the time is accompliſhed, and the harveſt ripe, he will thruſt in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſicle firſt,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62818:83"/>
and then all his ſervants, the Angels, ſhall fall to reaping the harveſt of this world.</p>
               <p>And ſhall thruſt in their ſicles, and reap until all be cut down, that is, Chriſt ſhall come in the clouds of heaven, with all his holy Angels to deſtroy this world for ever.</p>
               <p>Then will he thruſt in his ſicle indeed: and this is the meaning of the ſicle in his hand.</p>
               <p>And thoſe Angels that cryed to him, that ſate upon the cloud to thruſt in the ſicle, are the holy Angels aforeſaid, that muſt help to reap the world, for they have ſicles alſo.</p>
               <p>That is, the Angels have power from Chriſt to deſtroy, and cut down this wicked world when their ſins are at the full, then are they ripe, fit to be deſtroyed, even as the temporal <hi>Babylon</hi> was, when their ſins was ripe, as in <hi>Joel</hi> the 3.13. verſe, <hi>Put you in the ſicle, for the harveſt is ripe, come get you down, for the preſs is full, the fats overflow, for the wickedneſs is great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> ſpake this in relation to the reaping of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the enemies of the Jews, that after the ſeventy years captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their enemies ſins of cruel uſage was at the full, or ripe.</p>
               <p>So that now the ſicle, that is, the power of the ſword temporal, muſt utterly deſtroy <hi>Babylon</hi> the Jews enemies, or reap it, for the harveſt of their ſins and cruelties were fully ripe.</p>
               <p>And the preſs was full, that is, their bodies were ſo full of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and cruelty, that they did overflow with wickedneſs, their wickedneſs was ſo great.</p>
               <p>So will it be with this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the harveſt is ripe; for this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſo full of idolatry, of idols, images, and worſhipping falſe gods, and perſecution of the Saints,</p>
               <p>That the preſs is full, that is, their bodies are ſo full of ſpiritual wickedneſs, or ſpiritual fornication, and perſecution for conſcience ſake, as aforeſaid, that their wickedneſs doth overflow even as the aforeſaid <hi>Babylon</hi> did.</p>
               <p>So that in the account of the ſpirit of faith, this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> is as really deſtroyed and reaped, their ſins being ripe, as the other <hi>Babylon</hi> was.</p>
               <p>And as the ſicle was thruſt into them that they were deſtroyed, and reaped ſo will it be with this, as in the nineteenth verſe of this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62818:84"/>
chapter, <hi>And the Angel thruſt in his ſicle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and caſt it into the great wine-preſs of the wrath of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The earth ſignifies the people, and the vine of the earth ſignifies the wicked idolatrous worſhip of the people: and the great wine-preſs of the wrath of God ſignifies that eternal death, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon all idolatrous people, who worſhip falſe gods.</p>
               <p>This eternal or ſecond death is the great wine-preſs of the wrath of God, and in the twentieth verſe of this Chapter it is ſaid, <hi>And the wine-preſs was troden without the City, and blood came out of the wine-preſs, even unto the horſe bridles, by the ſpace of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſix hundred furlongs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is this, the wine-preſs was troden without the City, that is, the deſtruction of the enemies of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> it was without the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo will the eternal deſtruction of all idolaters at the end of the world be without the City, <hi>New-Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, none of the Seed of Faith who are the holy City, in the ſpiritual, ſhall ſee their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>For blood ſhall come out of the wine-preſs, even to the horſe bridles: the blood ſignifies the extream torment, it being for ever.</p>
               <p>The wine-preſs ſignifies the great wrath of God, preſſing their ſouls for their wickedneſs to eternity.</p>
               <p>Unto the horſe bridles ſignifies the extream fulneſs of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo that the wrath of God might walk in their ſouls, even as an horſe may do thorow blood, even up to his bridle.</p>
               <p>For Gods wrath will he as many horſes to cruſh and trample his enemies under feet, ſo that their miſeries may break forth as blood for Gods horſes, that is, his vengeance, to walk thorow to eternity.</p>
               <p>As for the ſpace of a thouſand and ſix hundred furlongs, that ſignifies a great ſpace and diſtance from the City of God, that is from the ſpiritual City of God, to wit, the true believers.</p>
               <p>So that this ſpiritual myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, as aforeſaid,</p>
               <p>I ſay ſhe muſt undergo the wrath of God, and be troden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpiritual City, the Seed of Faith both Jew and Gentile, being called that holy City, even as the other <hi>Babylon</hi> was tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and deſtroyed without the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>CHapter the fifteenth in the firſt verſe, John <hi>ſaw another ſign in heaven, great and marvellous, ſeven Angels having the ſeven laſt Plagues, for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great and marvellous ſign that <hi>John</hi> ſaw in heaven, it was thoſe Plagues or wrath of God, that was to be poured out upon this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thoſe beaſts, and nations, and people, who did drink of the cup of her fornication of idolatry; which is more explained in the ſixteenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſaw another ſign, great and marvellous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid to be another ſign, becauſe he ſpake in the chapter before much of that temporal <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the Plagues and fall of it.</p>
               <p>But in this fifteenth chapter theſe Plagues hath relation onely to this myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> therefore ſaid to be another ſign in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, great and marvellous.</p>
               <p>It is great and marvellous indeed, for he ſaw the utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and end of the world, therefore calls them the ſeven laſt Plagues before upon the other <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe ſeven Plagues, are the laſt Plagues that are to be poured out upon the earth, therefore called by the Spirit <hi>marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> becauſe the whole wrath or final wrath of God, is filled up or finiſhed upon the whore, beaſt, falſe prophets, and all idolatrous perſons in the world.</p>
               <p>And this is to be executed by ſeven Angels, that is, theſe ſeven holy Angels have Commiſſion from God, to pour out thoſe ſeven laſt Plagues in a ſuitableneſs or likeneſs to thoſe Plagues that was poured out upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> as will appear in the next chapter.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond verſe, John <hi>ſaw as it were a Sea of glaſs mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the numbers of his name, ſtand on the Sea of glaſs, having the harps of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader may remember that I have ſhewed before, when I treated upon the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that there is a Chryſtal Sea like unto glaſs or Chryſtal waters in heaven above the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62818:85"/>
Stars, as really as there is Sea of waters here upon the earth, and as certain as ſhips and other veſſels can, and do ſwim, or glide upon the Sea and waters here below.</p>
               <p>So may ſpiritual bodies ſtand or walk upon the Sea of glaſs in heaven above the Stars.</p>
               <p>And this Sea of glaſs is mingled with fire, it is ſaid to be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with fire, to ſignifie the purity of it the more, becauſe fire is that which purifies more then any thing but water.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſpirit of God is compared to fire, and to water, as Chriſt ſhall baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire, and Chriſt will give every true believer water of Life, ſo that as the Spirit of God, the operation of it, is compared to fire and to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thoſe two being the purifying things upon earth.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe this Sea of glaſs mingled with fire, which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in heaven, it was that Chryſtal Sea, or Chryſtal waters like unto clear glaſs.</p>
               <p>Which was before the Throne of God, as in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> aforeſaid, <hi>And</hi> John <hi>ſaw all them that had gotten the victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, ſtand on the Sea of Glaſs, having the harps of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, the Saints of God who by their patient ſuffering, they got the victory over the beaſt; for faith and patience will conquer the greateſt enemies in the world, both within a man, and without a man.</p>
               <p>And this faith and patience in the Saints, in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</p>
               <p>Was that which kept them from worſhipping of idols, images, or ſubmitting any ways to that falſe worſhip ſet up by the beaſt.</p>
               <p>And in this regard the Saints may be ſaid, to get victory over the beaſt, his image, mark, and name.</p>
               <p>Which things I have opened before, onely this is to be minded by the way, that the Saints that getteth this victory over all falſe worſhip, they ſhall have ſpiritual bodies, that ſhall be capable to ſtand upon the Sea of glaſs in heaven, even upon that Chryſtal Sea, which is round about the throne of God.</p>
               <p>Even as men do ſtand upon ſhips upon the Sea of this world, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Obſerve: if there be ſuch power in ſaith in bodies that are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62818:85"/>
as to make them to walk upon the waters, as in Chriſt, and in <hi>Peter,</hi> who walked in thoſe bodies of fleſh upon the waters, how much more ſhall thoſe whoſe faith is become a fiery glory which hath ſpiritualized the whole body?</p>
               <p>That is, it is a ſpiritual body capable to ſtand upon the Sea of glaſs in heaven, as our earthly bodies are upon the firmeſt earth here below.</p>
               <p>And thoſe Saints that ſtand upon this chryſtal Sea of glaſs, theſe have the harps of God. Now what is meant by the harps I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And in the third verſe, theſe that ſtood upon the Sea of glaſs, having the harps of God, <hi>they ſing the Song of Moſes, and the Song of the Lamb,</hi> which two Songs I have opened before.</p>
               <p>Now what the words of the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Song of the Lamb are, ſome of them are ſet down in the third and fourth verſes.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that ſtood upon the Sea of glaſs with the harps of God, did ſing theſe two Songs in thoſe words aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Their tongues being the harps of God to ſound forth his praiſe and glory for his great mercies towards them.</p>
               <p>There is nothing elſe of any great concernment to know in this Chapter, but what I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of in the chapters following, therefore I ſhall ſay no more, nor interpret no more of this fifteenth Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLVI.</head>
               <p>IN the ſixteenth Chapter and the firſt verſe, <hi>John heard a great voice out of the Temple, ſaying to the ſeven Angels, Go your ways and pour out the Vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeven Angels are to pour out the ſeven laſt Plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, they are called <hi>ſeven Angels,</hi> becauſe of thoſe ſeven ſeveral Plagues that are to be poured out upon the earth in the laſt dayes.</p>
               <p>Theſe Angels who had the ſeven laſt Plagues to pour out upon the earth, they were of the holy Angels; but whether they were juſt ſeven, more or leſs, is not much material.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Plagues are counted but into ſeven, therefore called <hi>ſeven Angels who poured out their Vials of the wrath of God;</hi> which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62818:86"/>
wrath of God are thoſe ſeven Plagues, when as one or two Angels might at the command of God pour out all thoſe ſeven vials.</p>
               <p>But this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> doth ſpeak much of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And 1. of the ſeven Spirits of God before the Throne. 2. of ſeven Angels of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and of the ſeven Churches themſelves.</p>
               <p>Alſo he ſpeaks of a Lamb with ſeven horns, and ſeven eyes, and a beaſt with ſeven heads, and now of ſeven Angels, and ſeven vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and ſeven plagues.</p>
               <p>So that this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> doth ſpeak much upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which ſometimes them ſeven ſpoken of, were but one, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Yet they may be called ſeven, in relation to thoſe ſeven ſeveral operations or works they do.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe I would have the Reader minde, that theſe ſeven vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the wrath of God, that are to be poured out by theſe ſeven Angels, they have relation unto thoſe plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> that was poured out by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Angel of the Covenant of the Law.</p>
               <p>Which Nation of the Jews was called <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> for God had eſtabliſhed his worſhip of the Law in, and upon them.</p>
               <p>And the voice of God to <hi>Moſes</hi> the Angel of the Covenant of the Law, commanded him to pour out the vials of his wrath upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>Alſo we read in Scriptures, of ſeveral of the holy Angels that poured out vials of the wrath of God, as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> the Angel of the Law.</p>
               <p>As thoſe two Angels that came to <hi>Lot,</hi> poured out the vial of Gods wrath upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and burnt it to aſhes.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Angel of the Lord deſtroyed threeſcore thouſand people of the plague, for <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in numbring the people.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Angel of the Lord ſlew fourſcore thouſand men in one night of the King of <hi>Aſſyria's</hi> hoſt, according to the words of the prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With many other examples in Scripture, that Angels did pour out the vials of Gods wrath upon the earth in former times.</p>
               <p>But theſe ſeven Angels, and the ſeven plagues that are to be poured out upon the earth, I ſay the meaning of <hi>John</hi> was, that they ſhould be poured out upon thoſe wicked beaſts and falſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62818:86"/>
or falſe prophets, who ſetup a falſe worſhip, and all falſe worſhippers ever ſince that day that Chriſt entered into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, or ſince the time that the Apoſtles received their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>My meaning is this, that ever ſince the Apoſtles had thoſe clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven tongues ſate upon them, as of fire; for then began people to worſhip Chriſt according to the Apoſtles directions, who had their Commiſſion from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now what worſhip hath been ſet up ſince by Kings or Head-Magiſtrates, who had no Commiſſion from God, they are called by the Spirit <hi>evil beaſts, falſe prophets, falſe preachers, and falſe worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thoſe ſeven Angels poured out their ſeven plagues upon thoſe ſuperſtitions and idolatrous people, who have drunk of the wine of the fornication of idolatry, in worſhipping falſe gods or idols ever ſince the Worſhip of the Goſpel was ſet up by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I declare that theſe ſeven laſt plagues are to be poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemies of the Goſpel of Jeſus, he being the Angel of the New Covenant of Faith, and Chriſt dwelling in their hearts by faith, ſo that the true Believers of the Goſpel are called by the Spirit <hi>The Temple of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this great voice which <hi>John</hi> heard out of the Temple, was no other but the voice of Chriſt who gave charge unto his Angels to pour out the ſeven vials of his wrath, which are ſeven plagues, upon the earth.</p>
               <p>That is, upon wicked, idolatrous people, who worſhip idols, images, and falſe gods ſince the Apoſtles Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Even ſuch like plagues as <hi>Moſes</hi> the Angel of the Law, and other Angels did pour out upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and upon other wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader obſerve, and he may ſee that theſe laſt plagues that are poured out upon the beaſt, his image, and thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the mark, and the number of his name.</p>
               <p>That is, upon all idolatrous people, they are much like unto thoſe plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as aforeſaid, as you may perceive in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vials pouring out thoſe ſeven plagues.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond verſe, <hi>The firſt went and poured out his vial upon the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62818:87"/>
earth, and there fell a noiſom and grievous ſore upon the men, which had the mark of the beaſt, and upon them which worſhipped his image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Plague the firſt Angel poured out, it was upon thoſe people that received the mark of the beaſt, and thoſe which did worſhip his image</p>
               <p>Even the ſame Plague was poured out upon the ſervants, and inhabitants of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for their wicked oppreſſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they had grievous ſores upon them, as you may ſee, <hi>Exodus</hi> 9.10, and 11 verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſores were ſo grievous upon the Egyptians, and upon the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that they could not ſtand before</hi> Moſes, <hi>for the boyls were upon the Magicians, both upon man, and beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in like manner is the Plague poured out upon the enemies of the worſhip of the Goſpel of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Verſe the third, <hi>And the ſecond Angel poured out his vial upon the ſea, and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living ſoul died in the ſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſecond Angel poured out his vial, and the Plague this Angel poured out, it was much like to the Plague <hi>Moſes</hi> poured out upon <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As you may ſee <hi>Exodus</hi> the 7. and the 17. how the rod in <hi>Moſes</hi> hand ſmote upon the waters that were in the rivers, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came blood, or was turned into blood.</p>
               <p>And in the 18. verſe, <hi>And the fiſh that is in the river ſhall die, and the river ſhall ſtink, and the Egyptians ſhall loath to drink of the water of the river.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in like manner will God pour out this vial of wrath upon the ſea, that is, upon all the rivers and fountains of water, which is for the comfort, ſatisfaction, and quenching the thirſt of man and all other creatures.</p>
               <p>For the vial being poured out upon the Sea, the Sea doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all manner of waters whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And as this plague was poured out upon <hi>Egypt</hi> at the firſt, when <hi>Moſes</hi> had his Commiſſion from God to gather <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the end of the world, when Chriſt ſhall gather his elect together, that is, the wheat from the tares.</p>
               <p>This vial of his wrath ſhall be poured out upon the Sea, as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it was poured out upon <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:62818:87"/>And every creature in the Sea, both man, and beaſt, fiſh, and fowl ſhall die, even as they did in <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>ANd verſe the fourth, <hi>The third Angel poured out his Vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that as the Egyptians rivers and fountains of waters were turned to blood by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo that the Egyptians could not drink of the waters of the rivers, for they did loath to drink of them.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe this Vial the third Angel poured out, it was the wrath of God upon the fountain and river of water that is in every man.</p>
               <p>For every man hath motions of peace, and refreſhing of minde that doth ariſe in his heart from the ſeed of reaſon, the root which doth ſend forth refreſhing thoughts, motions and actions.</p>
               <p>Many times the ſeed of reaſon doth this, which is as a river of water to refreſh the ſoul of man.</p>
               <p>But when evil thoughts, motions, and actions, do ariſe out of the heart, it cauſeth fear, wrath, and torment of ſoul, both of the puniſhment of the Law here in this life, and the puniſhment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation hereafter.</p>
               <p>So that the rivers and fountains of waters that doth flow out of the hearts of men and women, they are turned into blood.</p>
               <p>That is, as I ſaid before, the motions, thoughts, and actions, which did ariſe out of the heart that yielded peace to the minde, they were as water to refreſh the heart of man, even as water doth quench the thirſt of nature, both of man and beaſt.</p>
               <p>But when theſe waters of the ſoul be turned to blood, there is nothing but thoughts of fear, motions of wrath, and fear of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death.</p>
               <p>So that the ſoul of man is loth, or doth loath to drink of thoſe thoughts, motions, and actions which are turned to blood, that is, to wrath, and fear of eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>But drink they muſt of the wine of the wrath of God, for they have made the Saints to drink of the wine and wrath of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, for not worſhipping the beaſt nor his image, nor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:62818:88"/>Though I ſpeak of all men and women in general, becauſe all people have a river of water in their hearts, but all rivers are not turned to blood.</p>
               <p>But the meaning is, all thoſe people who worſhip the beaſt &amp; his image, who receive the mark of his name, or the number of his names, theſe things includes both the beaſt, and all falſe worſhips, and falſe worſhippers; ſince Chriſt gave the Commiſſion of the Goſpel to his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Moſes</hi> poured out that Plague of turning the natural ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and fountains of water of <hi>Egypt</hi> to blood, at the firſt coming into his Commiſſion of the Law.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe will Chriſt pour out his vial of wrath upon the ſpirits of men and women, and turn the waters of their ſouls to blood, as aforeſaid, and this will be executed at the latter end of the world, which end will be as certain as the beginning was by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>John</hi> by the ſpirit of <hi>Revelation, ſaw theſe vials poured out upon the beaſt, and his ſeat, and upon his image, and upon thoſe that had his mark, name, or number of his name,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>For it is the nature of true faith to ſee things afar off, or at a diſtance as near at hand, or in preſent being.</p>
               <p>So that this vial of Gods wrath, which the third Angel poured out upon the rivers, and fountains of waters, I declare it is meant upon the ſouls, that is, upon the peace of the ſouls of thoſe wicked beaſts, or Head-Magiſtrates who ſet up images, idols, and forms of falſe worſhip, and cauſe the people ſo to do.</p>
               <p>And all thoſe people that do bow down to this worſhip, they receive the mark of the beaſt, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name, upon all theſe their ſouls is this vial poured out upon.</p>
               <p>That is, upon the peace of all their ſouls, which peace is called by the Spirit, <hi>rivers and fountains of waters,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon theſe rivers and fountains of waters, the Angel doth pour out his vial, and turn the waters of idolatrous men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſouls to blood.</p>
               <p>For this the Reader is to minde, that there is motions that doth run in the minde of man, as the waters doth in a river or ſpring.</p>
               <p>And theſe motions doth cool or ſatisfie the ſoul of man, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doth when men are athirſt:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:62818:88"/>As the rich man Chriſt ſpeaks of, who being in hell deſired one drop of cold water to cool his tongue, that is, one motion of peace or hope of deliverance out of this heat;</p>
               <p>For if there could but one motion of peace ariſe out of the heart of one being in hell, it would be that drop of cold water to cool the tongue of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But theſe waters being turned to blood by the vial of Gods wrath being poured upon it, no waters can ariſe.</p>
               <p>That is, no peace can ſpring from the ſouls of men and women, who have this vial poured out upon them, that is, who have the waters of their ſouls turned to blood, that is, to wrath, torment, and the fear of eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Reader may know, that the motions of peace in a mans minde, may be called <hi>a river of water,</hi> you may minde the words of Chriſt, where he ſaith, <hi>He that believeth in me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe Chriſt ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, If thou hadſt asked me, I would have given the Water of Life:</hi> it ſhould have been a Well ſpringing up unto eternal life.</p>
               <p>Theſe waters flow from the Seed of Faith in the ſoul of men and women: theſe are not thoſe waters that are turned to blood.</p>
               <p>But there are waters that proceed from the ſeed of Reaſon in the heart of men and women, which are motions of natural peace that doth ariſe from the ſeed of Reaſon in man, and theſe are thoſe waters that are turned to blood by the pouring out of the vial of Gods wrath upon them, as will appear by Scripture.</p>
               <p>As firſt, the waters of <hi>Cains</hi> ſoul was turned to blood for killing his brother <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The waters of curſed <hi>Cham,</hi> his ſoul was turned to blood for uncovering his fathers nakedneſs, in that he procured the curſe of his father, and <hi>Cain</hi> had more torment upon his ſoul than he could bear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The waters of <hi>Eſau's</hi> ſoul was turned to blood, for deſpiſing his Birth-right.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The waters of King <hi>Saul's</hi> ſoul was turned into blood, for diſobeying the Commandment of the Lord, in that it cauſed him to enquire of a Witch.</p>
               <p>Theſe being all of them the ſeed of Reaſon, and the waters, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62818:89"/>
is, the motions of peace that did ariſe from that Seed, as you may read that <hi>Saul</hi> had many, or much peace, for he was called <hi>Saul amongſt the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further it is ſaid, <hi>that the good Spirit of the Lord departed from him, and an evil ſpirit from the Lord was ſent unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, the motions of peace departed from him, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of fear and horror was ſent unto him.</p>
               <p>That is, the waters of his ſoul were turned to blood, and ſo will it be not onely with theſe afore-mentioned, but with all the ſeed of the ſerpent who rebel againſt God, and that worſhip falſe gods, as theſe beaſts, and all thoſe that receive his mark.</p>
               <p>So that to conclude, this vial of Gods wrath of turning the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and fountains of waters to blood, it hath relation to all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Kings and Head-Magiſtrates, who are called by the Spirit <hi>Beaſts;</hi> and all thoſe that receive the mark in the fore-head, or right hand, or his name, or the number of his name.</p>
               <p>For the mark, name, and number of his name, doth include all falſe worſhippers, or idolaters whatſoever.</p>
               <p>So that this plague which is poured out by the third Angel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rivers and fountains of waters, it is upon all thoſe peoples ſouls aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>So that no motion of peace could ariſe in their ſouls, not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, this being one of the laſt vials of Gods wrath, which he will pour out upon this wicked, unbelieving, perſecuting, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous world.</p>
               <p>Turning the waters of their ſouls to blood, that is, all their peace ſhall be turned to fear, horror, and torment for ever and ever. So much for the fourth verſe, and the third vial.</p>

               <p>IN the fifth verſe, <hi>And I heard the Angel of the waters ſay, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and waſt, and ſhalt be, becauſe thou haſt judged thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 6. <hi>For they have ſhed the blood of Saints and Prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink: for they are worthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Angel of the waters, is the ſame Angel that poured out his vial upon the waters aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:62818:89"/>And the Angel giveth thanks unto Chriſt the onely God, becauſe he hath judged thus.</p>
               <p>That is, becauſe he hath poured out the vial of his wrath upon all perſecuting devils, and worſhippers of devils.</p>
               <p>For thoſe that perſecute, and thoſe that worſhip idols, are all one, for they all help to ſhed the blood of Saints and Prophets, ſo that Saints and Prophets are forced to drink of the wine of the wrath of their fornication, in that they ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So in like manner God doth make them to drink of the wine of his wrath, in that he gives them blood to drink.</p>
               <p>That is, they have their own blood to drink, for they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and their own blood is nothing elſe but the wrath of God working in their ſouls, which turns all the motions of their mindes into blood, ſo that they have nothing to drink, but the blood of their own ſouls.</p>
               <p>For as they drunk the blood of Saints and Prophets, in that they ſhed their blood with delight, becauſe they would not bow down to their worſhip.</p>

               <p>

               <p>For the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> by fire, it was onely to ſignifie that the deſtruction of the world at the end of time, ſhall be burnt up by fire, as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gemorrah</hi> was.</p>
               <p>And that the Angel of the Lord by vertue of his Commiſſion, ſhall pour out his vial of Gods wrath upon the Sun, that is, the Angel ſhall cauſe or command the Sun to give forth its heat, that ſhall ſet the element on fire.</p>

               <p>For God will puniſh idolaters, with the ſame puniſhment as the people of <hi>Sodom,</hi> who committed ſuch things as is unnatural; for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> being burnt with fire, it was an example onely to ſhew what God will do at the end of time, unto this wicked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing world, he will overthrow it, even it he did the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe the Reader may ſee, that the vial of Gods wrath was poured out upon the Sun, to execute his wrath upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> in that the Sun burnt up thoſe two Cities, and the people thereof, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.23, 24 verſes, it is ſaid, <hi>The Sun was riſen upon the earth, when</hi> Lot <hi>entered into</hi> Zoar.</p>
               <p>That is, the Sun was the captain or head governor of that fire and brimſtone, that was rained down from heaven upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Gods wrath was poured out upon the Sun, that the Sun might pour it out upon <hi>Sodom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For when the Sun was riſen upon the earth, that is, when the original or captain of all fire did ariſe on the earth, it commands brimſtone and fire to rain down upon thoſe two Cities.</p>
               <p>Even as a General of an Army doth command his men to fall on upon his enemies.</p>
               <p>For the Sun is appointed of God, to be the chief Governor of

               <p>So that the Sun is obedient to Gods command, and if God doth give an Angel a Commiſſion to command the Sun to give forth its heat, and to burn, and conſume a People, City, or Nation, then it may be ſaid, that the Angel poured out his vial upon the Sun.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the Angel poured the vial of Gods wrath upon the Sun.</p>
               <p>And the Sun poured it out upon the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> in that it cauſed fire and brimſtone to rain down upon them, until they were utterly conſumed.</p>
               <p>So in like manner, will this Angel pour out his vial upon the Sun at the end of time, and the Sun ſhall do by the wicked as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, as the Sun did by <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that was, as I ſaid before, onely to ſignifie what will be done at the end of time.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>John</hi> in his viſion ſaw the thing done, that is, according to his faith it is done, for faith admits of no time but what is preſent.</p>
               <p>But this I would have the Reader to minde, though there will be deſtruction by the fire of the Sun at the end of the world, like unto that of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> as aforeſaid,</p>

               <p>This Sun ſpoken of here, it doth ſignifie in the ſpiritual the Son of God, <hi>whoſe eyes are like a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fiue braſs.</hi>

                  <hi>This is he that treadeth the wine-preſs of the fierceneſs and wrath of Almighty God,</hi> as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.15.</p>
               <p>Now as the vial of Gods wrath was poured out upon the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sun, in that the Sun had power to burn up <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Son of righteouſneſs had the vial of Gods wrath poured out upon him alſo.</p>

               <p>This power alſo doth he give to every true Prophet, and Apoſtle, and Miniſter, whom he doth chuſe.</p>

               <p>It doth ſcorch their conſciences with the fear of eternal death, which is the fire of hell, as in the nineth verſe, <hi>And men were ſcorched with great heat, and blaſphemed the Name of God, which hath power over theſe Plagues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that every true Meſſenger of Chriſt, hath power to ſcorch the conſciences of men, and to kindle the fire of hell in all perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſpirits, and falſe worſhippers, who worſhip falſe gods.</p>
               <p>And this fire, and heat was very much poured out by the Apoſtles, and thoſe Miniſters, ordained by them in the primitive times, ſo called.</p>
               <p>For none knows what thoſe perſecuting beaſts, and falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers who received the beaſts mark, did ſuffer, nor how their conſciences were ſcorched with the fire of hell, even whileſt they were in this world, which was but a taſte of what ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But this taſte it made them blaſpheme againſt him that had power over theſe Plagues.</p>
               <p>For the minde of man is ſo deſperately wicked, that if he could deſtroy that God that hath power over theſe Plagues, even as they did thoſe his meſſengers, and the Saints that believed them.</p>
               <p>But the Saints may ſee, that there is a ſecret ſpiritual power in every true Meſſenger of God, to ſcorch the ſouls of perſecuting, and deſpiſing men and women, with the heat of hell fire: this I know to be true by experience, as well as by faith.</p>
               <p>For the doctrine of the true God, and his true Worſhip, it doth torment the ſouls of the ſeed of the ſerpent inwardly, as the heat
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62818:91"/>
of the Sun doth outwardly to a mans body, and men are more ſubject to blaſpheme for the torment within, then they are for torments without.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the one is but for a time, but the other is for eternity.</p>
               <p>So that the ſpiritual ſcorching with great heat, is that <hi>John</hi> chiefly intends in this chapter, in relation to the torment of mind that was upon thoſe beaſts that perſecuted the Saints, and all thoſe that received his mark, as aforeſaid,</p>
               <p>In the time of the Apoſtles Commiſſion, and with relation to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Thus in ſome meaſure, I have given the litteral and ſpiritual meaning of the fourth Angel, pouring out his vial upon the Sun, and of the 8. and 9. verſes.</p>

               <p>VErſe the tenth, <hi>And the fifth Angel poured our his vial upon the ſeat of the beaſt, and his kingdom was full of darkneſs, and they gnawed their tongues for pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This fifth vial it hath a twofold meaning, that is, a litteral and ſpiritual meaning.</p>
               <p>The litteral meaning is in relation to the vial, or plague that <hi>Moſes</hi> poured out upon Egypt, as you may ſee <hi>Exodus</hi> the 10.22, 23 <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſtreched forth his hand towards heaven, and there was a thick darkneſs in all the land of Egypt three days,</hi> and in the 23. verſe, <hi>They ſaw not one another, neither roſe any from his place for three days, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Reader may ſee, that this vial was poured out in the natural upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and upon the ſeat of the King of <hi>Egypt, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ah</hi> being king.</p>
               <p>Therefore called the <hi>beaſt:</hi> and the ſeat of the beaſt ſignifies the power and authority that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had over all the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Vial being poured out upon the ſeat of the beaſt, it ſignifies upon all thoſe that were under his government.</p>
               <p>That is, that were of his own people, ſo that there was thick darkneſs in the Kings palace, and upon his ſervants, no place free, as there was upon the inhabitants of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo that darkneſs was all over the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> no place free.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:62818:92"/>For if any place had been free from darkneſs in the land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> then I ſay the vial had not been poured out upon the ſeat of the beaſt.</p>
               <p>So that this vial <hi>Moſes</hi> poured out of thick darkneſs, it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeat of the beaſt, that is upon King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in whom the power and authority of <hi>Egypt</hi> did ſtand.</p>
               <p>So that when darkneſs was poured out upon the King, in whom the light of all the Laws of <hi>Egypt</hi> did ſhine forth upon the people; if the Seat in whom the Law is placed be darkned, then the people which muſt obey, muſt needs be darkned alſo.</p>
               <p>For where a King or Head Magiſtrate hath power given him either from God, or from man, to make Laws for people to obey, that power and authority is called by the Spirit, <hi>the Seat of the beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when God doth pour out the vial of his wrath upon this Authority, then I ſay the vial may be ſaid to be poured out upon the Seat of the Beaſt: ſo that the Reader may ſee what is meant by the Seat of the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Now I have opened a little what is the litteral or natural mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fifth Angel pouring out his vial or plague upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and what the Plague was, and what the Seat of the Beaſt is, I ſhall now alſo give you to underſtand the ſpiritual meaning of theſe things aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Obſerve there was many <hi>Pharaohs</hi> that were Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> in thoſe four hundred years that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet all theſe King <hi>Pharaohs</hi> are included in that one King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> unto whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent.</p>
               <p>So that all the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> are counted by the Spirit but one King <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all thoſe Plagues which <hi>Moſes</hi> poured out upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was upon this King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> even until God had utterly conſumed him, and he did in the Red-ſea: theſe things were fulfilled in the hiſtory, and in the natural, at the beginning of <hi>Moſes</hi> Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And that beaſt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> king of <hi>Egypt</hi> his actions of oppreſſion to the Iſraelites, they were upon the temporal ſtate of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo the vials and Plagues that was poured out upon him, they were temporal Plagues alſo.</p>
               <p>And there was a temporal darkneſs for three days all over <hi>Egypt,</hi> which darkneſs was but a ſhadow or type of that ſpiritual darkneſs
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62818:92"/>
upon the mind of man now, and the eternal darkneſs at the end of the world.</p>

               <head>CHAP. L.</head>
               <p>NOw I would have the Reader to obſerve, that this beaſt here ſpoken of by <hi>John,</hi> it was that beaſt that did riſe out of the Sea, having ſeven heads, as in Chapter the thirteenth, verſe the firſt, to whom the Dragon gave his Power, Seat, and Authority: this was the firſt beaſt that perſecuted the ſaints after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Commiſſion came to be publiſhed upon the earth.</p>
               <p>That is, this was the firſt beaſt that made war with the ſaints about worſhip.</p>
               <p>And ſo the ſame Spirit, Power, and Authority that was in this beaſt, it did run thorow the loins of all other beaſts that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him all the time of the ten Perſecutions.</p>
               <p>And the ſame ſpirit hath, and doth run in the line of all wicked, perſecuting Idolaters, Kings and Head-magiſtrates; they are called by the Spirit but one beaſt.</p>
               <p>And look what beaſt, or beaſts, are alive at the end of the world, they ſhall be all counted but one beaſt, and ſhall all be overthrown with one overthrow, even as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was.</p>
               <p>For though there was many <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, yet in the deſtruction of that one King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> all wicked <hi>Pharaohs</hi> are deſtroyed in him.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>Herod</hi> that did ſeek to kill Chriſt when he was born, in that he ſlew all the male children in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> who were two years old or under.</p>
               <p>I declare this <hi>Herod</hi> was that Dragon <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of in divers places in the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who gave his power, ſeat, and authority unto this beaſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſucceſſively the ſpirit of the Dragon, it runs thorow the line of all wicked beaſts to the worlds end, even as the ſpirit of the Dragon did run thorow the lines of many <hi>Herods,</hi> ſince <hi>Cains</hi> birth.</p>
               <p>Yet this <hi>Herod</hi> that perſecuted Chriſt, as ſoon as he was born, is called by the ſpirit in <hi>John,</hi> that great red Dragon.</p>
               <p>And his ſpirit of perſecution it was given to all thoſe wicked beaſts that did ſucceed immediately after him, and that ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:62818:93"/>For this is to be minded by the Reader, that the <hi>Herod</hi> that would have killed Chriſt, he died before this beaſt had any power, but <hi>Herod</hi> the Dragons ſpirit remained in other <hi>Herods,</hi> as that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> that beheaded <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> who was eaten up with lice.</p>
               <p>So that there was more <hi>Herods</hi> than one, yet the ſame ſpirit of <hi>Cain</hi> the devil was in them all.</p>
               <p>So that they may be called by the Spirit, but one <hi>Herod,</hi> dragon, or devil, they being all guided by one evil ſpirit, even the ſpirit of murdering <hi>Cain</hi> the firſt man-devil, or the devil become fleſh.</p>
               <p>So that this ſpirit of <hi>Cain</hi> who ruled in all thoſe <hi>Pharaohs</hi> and <hi>Herods</hi> before God was manifeſt in the fleſh, is that Dragon-devil who gave his power, ſeat, and authority unto the beaſt.</p>
               <p>That is, the ſpirit of the Dragon did perſecute, oppreſs, and kill before Chriſt came upon an natural account, for fear of looſing his kingdom, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> king of <hi>Egypt</hi> did.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Herod</hi> the Dragon he ſlew the young children, for fear Chriſt ſhould take his kingdom out of his hands.</p>
               <p>So that moſt of their cruel murthers they acted, it was upon a temporal account.</p>
               <p>But the cruelties that was acted by thoſe beaſts, it was upon a ſpiritual account; I call it <hi>a ſpiritual account,</hi> becauſe the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and putting to death of the Saints, it was for worſhipping of Chriſt according to the doctrine of the Apoſtles, who ſet up a worſhip contrary to that which was ſet up by thoſe beaſts.</p>
               <p>For there was a liberty granted of God unto the Worſhip of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the Jews to fight with the Sword of ſteel, and to deſtroy thoſe Kings or Beaſts that did moleſt them.</p>
               <p>But the Worſhip of the Goſpel did not teach men ſo to do, but altogether to the contrary.</p>
               <p>So that the ſufferings of the Saints under the Goſpel, and ever ſince, it is upon a ſpiritual account; for who ever doth ſuffer meerly for his Faith, or his Religion, or his Worſhip, he may be ſaid to ſuffer upon a ſpiritual account.</p>
               <p>And thoſe Beaſts that do perſecute upon that account, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute upon a ſpiritual account.</p>
               <p>Even as this Beaſt did ſpoken of by <hi>John,</hi> for this Beaſt did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Saints in the time of the Goſpel for worſhipping of Chriſt, and not worſhipping his Image, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62818:93"/>
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the temporal. And look what Plagues were pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the temporal, ſo likewiſe will ſpiritual Plagues be poured out upon the beaſt, and upon all that worſhip him, or his image.</p>
               <p>And as there was a natural darkneſs in all the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King, as upon the people, ſo likewiſe this ſpiritual darkneſs is poured out upon the ſeat of the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>That is, there is a darkneſs poured out upon the mindes of all evil Kings and Head-Magiſtrates, who undertake to ſet up Forms of Worſhip, as idols and images, for the people to worſhip.</p>
               <p>And there being a darkneſs poured out upon the minde of the Beaſt, ſo that he doth worſhip falſe gods: and not onely ſo, but this vial of darkneſs is poured out upon the mindes of all thoſe people who worſhip falſe gods.</p>
               <p>That is, there is a ſpiritual darkneſs upon the minde and ſpirit of the Beaſt, and all that worſhip a falſe god.</p>
               <p>I ſay a ſpiritual darkneſs is poured upon them all, even whileſt they are here in this world.</p>
               <p>Even as that natural darkneſs was poured out upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all the land of the Egyptians.</p>
               <p>I ſay there is as groſs a thick darkneſs poured out upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the greateſt part of men and women at this day, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true knowledge of God, and the true worſhip that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, as there was upon <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this ſpiritual darkneſs of the minde, it is but a preparation or fore-runner of that eternal darkneſs, which will as certainly be when time ſhall be no more, as the darkneſs of the minde is at preſent in all the ſeed of the ſerpent who worſhip falſe gods.</p>
               <p>But as there was light in all the places of the children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> dwellings, as you may ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.23. which dwellings of theirs it was in the Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> where the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.26.</p>
               <p>Now this Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> it ſignifies the light of grace, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and heavenly light in the mindes of the Seed of Faith: and the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſignifies the true Saints, or true Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God in ſpirit and truth.</p>
               <p>So that every true Believer in the true God, he may be ſaid to dwell in the Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> in his own minde; in which Land there
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62818:94"/>
is the light of Faith whereby they may ſee the way to that eternal light of Glory, where no ſad or melancholly thought ſhall ariſe to darken the light of peace, joy and everlaſting glory.</p>
               <p>So on the contrary, the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſignifies that hell and darkneſs of the minde.</p>
               <p>So that all thoſe who know not the true God, nor his true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they are in that ſpiritual darkneſs in their mindes, as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians were who gnawed their tongues for pain.</p>
               <p>Even ſo will it be with all thoſe wicked beaſts who have, and do ſet up Images, and Idols of gold, wood, and ſtone, or any falſe worſhip whatſoever, contrary to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Apoſtles, and the two Witneſſes of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>I ſay, all thoſe that worſhip contrary to theſe three Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they are in that ſpiritual Egyptian darkneſs in their mindes, whileſt they are here in this world.</p>
               <p>And this darkneſs in their ſpirits, it will lead them to that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal dark night, when as no light ſhall appear for ever.</p>
               <p>That is, no motion of peace, or hope of deliverance ſhall ariſe in their mindes for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>And then ſhall this Beaſt, and all that received his mark, name, or number of his name, gnaw their tongues for pain to eternity.</p>
               <p>For this Vial or Plague is poured out upon the ſeat of the beaſt, then of neceſſity it will follow that all that worſhip according to his command, will have the Vial of darkneſs poured out upon them alſo. So much for the interpretation of the fifth Vial, and of the tenth Verſe.</p>

               <p>I Shall paſs by the eleventh, and come to the twelfth verſe, <hi>And the ſixth Angel poured out his Vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the waters thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the eaſt might be prepared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great river <hi>Euphrates</hi> was in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where thoſe four Angels was bound, as I ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And as thoſe four Angels were looſed at the ſounding of the Trumpet of the ſixth Angel, ſo at the pouring out of the ſixth Vial this great river <hi>Euphrates</hi> muſt be dryed up.</p>

               <p>Alſo God will pour out his vial of wrath upon the ſpiritual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of man, even upon the great ſpiritual river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that is, upon all the ſouls and conſciences of wicked, idolatrous, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men and women all the world over.</p>
               <p>That is, the waters of their ſouls ſhall be dryed up, ſo that no motion of peace ſhall ariſe, or ſpring from their ſouls, to quench the thirſt of ſin then, no more then there did to <hi>Dives</hi> the rich man, who being in hell, wanted one drop of cold water to cool his tongue.</p>
               <p>But the river of his ſoul that did run with motions of peace in his natural life, it was now dryed up, ſo that no drop of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be had.</p>

               <p>So that both the great river <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the temporal, and the great river <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the ſpiritual, the waters of them both will be dryed up at the end of time, which thing will be unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſad to all thoſe who have no water of Life in their ſouls to drink.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid by the ſpirit of <hi>John, that this great river</hi> Euphrates <hi>was dryed up, that the way of the Kings of the eaſt might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what theſe Kings of the eaſt are, is very neceſſary to know.</p>
               <p>Theſe Kings of the Eaſt, I declare they are all good Kings: further I declare that Chriſt the King of Heaven, is ſaid to come out of the Eaſt, as you may read, <hi>Math.</hi> 2.2, 3 verſes, <hi>Where the wiſe men from the Eaſt came to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſaying, where is he that is born King of the Jews, for we have ſeen his Star in the Eaſt, and are come to worſhip him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this Jeſus the King of the Jews, he is called the King of the Eaſt, becauſe his Star in the Eaſt directed the wiſe men to finde him out, that they might worſhip him.</p>
               <p>Now this is to be minded by the Reader, that Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62818:95"/>
and Saints, they are called by the Spirit Kings, and Prieſts unto God, as the Scripture ſaith.</p>
               <p>So that all Prophets, Apoſtles, and true Believers may be called Kings.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the King of Kings came out of the Eaſt, theſe all following him in the ſame ſteps of faith and patience, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Spirit, <hi>Kings of the eaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Chriſt, his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Saints, are thoſe Kings of the Eaſt, who have the aforeſaid waters dryed up, that the way for theſe Kings of the Eaſt might be prepared.</p>
               <p>That is, there is no natural rivers upon earth, that ſhall hinder or keep from being dryed up, neither temporal nor ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>For the vial of Gods wrath, it will dry up all the rivers of waters upon earth natural, and all rivers of waters ſpiritual, when Chriſt ſhall come in the clouds of heaven with all his Saints, the Kings of the Eaſt, to put an end to this bloody, perſecuting, unbelieving world.</p>
               <p>And to dry up all the waters of peace in mens ſouls.</p>
               <p>And the Kings of the Eaſt, by their faith and patience, ſhall walk upon the waters of wicked, perſecuting mens ſouls, as upon dry ground.</p>
               <p>That is, the Kings of the Eaſt ſhall rejoyce in the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their enemies, even as their enemies did over them, when they perſecuted and put them to death.</p>
               <p>So that the way, that is, the hearts of the Saints enemies, may be as a way for the Kings of the Eaſt to tread and trample upon all that joy, peace, and comfort, that the Dragon beaſt, and falſe prophet had, when they perſecuted the Saints.</p>
               <p>Which Saints are the Kings of the Eaſt, and that faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the Saints had, it prepared themſelves to ſuffer with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs the perſecution, and death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>So that the waters of the great river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> even the waters of their perſecutors ſouls was dryed up, that the Kings of the Eaſt, that is, the Saints might be prepared to fight that good fight of Faith, as the Saints did in the time of the Ten Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So much for the interpretation of the twelfth verſe.</p>

               <p>VErſe the thirteenth, <hi>And I ſaw three unclean ſpirits like frogs, came out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three unclean ſpirits like frogs, they are ſaid to come out of the mouthes of three ſeveral perſons, to wit, the Dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet; yet theſe three proceed all from one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, even the ſpirit of the fallen Angel, or as I may ſay the ſpirit of <hi>Cain</hi> that Dragon-devil, who was the firſt murderer.</p>
               <p>And the ſpirit of <hi>Cain</hi> remaining in the ſeed, it bringeth forth many Dragon-devils like himſelf.</p>
               <p>So that all Dragon-devils make up but one Dragon, and ſo all wicked beaſts make up but one wicked beaſt, ſo all falſe prophets, and falſe prieſts, or falſe ſpeakers, they make up but one falſe prophet.</p>
               <p>Now they are called three unclean ſpirits, like frogs, in regard of the threefold operations and workings of them;</p>
               <p>For they proceeded from that one ſpirit of reaſon, the devil.</p>
               <p>Onely this one ſpirit of reaſon it doth work three ſeveral ways, and by three ſeveral perſons, yet all three of them were like frogs.</p>
               <p>They were all alike for wicked idolatry, and perſecution of the Saints, and to deceive the people.</p>
               <p>For they are the ſpirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to the battel of that great day of God Almighty, as in the 14 verſe of this chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that theſe three ſpirits like frogs, that came out of the Dragons mouth, and out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe prophet,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were to go forth to all the Kings of the earth, and not onely ſo, but to all great men in the whole world, to invite them to perſecute, and to fight againſt the Saints with a ſword of ſteel, and with other cruel deaths.</p>
               <p>When as the Saints had no other weapons of war, but thoſe that were ſpiritual, to wit, the ſword of the ſpirit, the ſhield of faith, the helmet of ſalvation, theſe and ſuch like weapons of war the Saints do fight withal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:62818:96"/>But the Dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet, they by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, power, and authority, did invite all the kings of the earth, and of the whole world to fight againſt the Lord Jeſus, and the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Seed of Faith, who are the Saints,</p>
               <p>With perſecution and death as aforeſaid, with carnal weapons, and inventions of cruel deaths, as the Scriptures, and Hiſtory doth make mention of.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> gave him to ſee, that the laſt battel that will be fought between God Almighty, and the dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet, it will be at the end of the world.</p>
               <p>That is, Jeſus Chriſt he is God Almighty, he, and his Saints, and Angels, ſhall fight with the dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet, and with all the Kings of the whole world.</p>
               <p>And he, and his Saints ſhall give them an utter overthrow, that is, an eternal overthrow, ſo that the dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet, with all the adherents unto them, ſhall be deſtroyed with a ſecond death, which ſhall burn as a lake of fire, for even and ever.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LIII.</head>
               <p>IT will be neceſſary to open ſomething more of the <hi>dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet, and of thoſe three unclean ſpirits like frogs that came out of their mouths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader may remember that I ſhewed before, that there was many dragons ſince <hi>Cain,</hi> yet all counted by the ſpirit but one dragon, and ſo of the beaſt, and falſe prophet, all are included in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one.</p>
               <p>Now this dragon ſpoken of, he is meant the ſame great red dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon ſpoken of in the 12. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who perſecuted the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, namely <hi>Herod,</hi> though there was many dragons after him, yet it is called all but one dragon, they being all partakers of the ſame ſpirit, and acted in the ſame perſecution of the Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So likewiſe that beaſt that did ariſe out of the Sea, with ſeven heads and ten horns,</hi> as in the thirteenth chapter, verſe the firſt.</p>
               <p>Is that beaſt ſpoken of here by the ſpirit, though there was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other beaſts after him, yet they acting by the ſame ſpirit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Saints, they are all called by the ſpirit, but one beaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:62818:97"/>So likewiſe the falſe prophet is meant that government of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that was eſtabliſhed upon the Chief or High-prieſts of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo that there was a ſpiritual government of worſhip which did belong to thoſe Images and Idols that was ſet up by the Power and Authority of the Beaſt</p>
               <p>As all Forms of Worſhips, let them be true or falſe, there muſt be ſome particular Head: as <hi>Aaron</hi> was High-prieſt of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Law, and Chriſt the Head of the Goſpel Worſhip; yet there was many more High-prieſts beſides <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet all called but <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>High-prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even ſo it was with the falſe prophet, the ſame ſpirit of idolatry and perſecution for conſcience ſake, for not ſubmitting to worſhip the beaſt and his image, it did run thorow the ſpirits of all the falſe prieſts, as it did in him that was the chief, who was ſet up by the power of the beaſt at the firſt.</p>
               <p>So that though there were many prieſts that ſucceeded him, and many that did officiate the prieſts Office beſides, yet they being all of one and the ſame ſpirit, they are called by the Spirit in <hi>John</hi> but one <hi>falſe prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For prieſts are called by the Spirit many times <hi>prophets,</hi> as <hi>Baal</hi> had four hundred falſe prophets did belong to him, that is, they were four hundred falſe prieſts.</p>
               <p>Now this I would have the Reader to minde, that theſe three ſpirits like frogs, that came out of the dragons mouth, and the beaſts mouth, and the falſe prophets mouth,</p>
               <p>I would not have the Reader to think that theſe three ſpirits like frogs, did ceaſe in the time of the ten Perſecutions, neither would I have him to think that there is no dragon, nor beaſt, nor falſe prophet now, though there was then.</p>
               <p>Although I confeſs the main drift of <hi>Johns Revelation</hi> had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chiefly to thoſe wonderful ſtrange actions that was acted by the dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet unto the Saints, in the time of that Commiſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But this is for certain, that the ſpirit of the dragon, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the beaſt, and the ſpirit of the falſe prophet, remains in its ſeed to this day, and will do to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>So that the ſpirit of the dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet, theſe three unclean ſpirits do ſend forth their ſpirits like frogs, to the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62818:97"/>
Kings of the earth, to encourage them all to fight againſt Truth and againſt true Worſhip, and to make the Saints to ſubmit to their idolatrous worſhip.</p>
               <p>For, as I ſaid before, all Forms of Worſhip that are ſet up by men who have no Commiſſion from God, is a falſe worſhip; and who ever is the chief Miniſter in that worſhip ſo ſet up, he may be ſaid to be a falſe prophet.</p>
               <p>And by this rule, all Opinions in Religion, and Forms of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or Worſhip, that is ſet up in the world at this day by ſeveral ſorts of people, they are all falſe, becauſe the Miniſters are falſe, and ſo they may be all called but one falſe prophet, even from the firſt Pope, to the laſt Quaker, their Miniſtery being all falſe, even one as well as the other.</p>

               <p>AGain, I ſhall give the Reader a little diſtinction of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral operations of theſe three ſpirits, and yet they all joyn together to fight againſt God Almighty.</p>
               <p>And yet cozen and cheat one another, and cheat the people of the world alſo.</p>
               <p>So that very few in the whole world doth eſcape being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by one, or more of theſe three unclean ſpirits like frogs that cometh out of the dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophets mouthes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the unclean ſpirit of the Dragon it ſeeketh after natural wiſdom, as Natural Philoſophy, Aſtrology, Magick, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Phyſician, or a Doctor of Phyſick to cure diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The wiſdom of the Dragon it doth pry into the knowledge of the Stars, and the influence of them, as the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> did, that they may be counted wiſe men.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe this ſpirit of the Dragon it doth pry into the nature of Herbs, Plants, with the ſpirits of all Vegetable, and all things of curious Arts, ſo that the ſpirit of the Dragon comes to be wiſer in things of nature, than all other men.</p>
               <p>So that all other men that are not skill'd in this wiſdom of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are ſubverted and deceived by this ſpirit, and do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him as a God, thinking that God hath given him more wiſdom in this kinde, than to all other men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:62818:98"/>So that this knowledge of Natural Philoſophy, Aſtrology, and by ſick, makes men become honorable in the ſight of all people.</p>
               <p>Alſo it makes the people to part with their ſilver freely; alſo it clothes the Phyſician in rich Velvet, ſo that people may know what he is by his Veſture.</p>
               <p>All this honor, and much more than I can relate, doth the ſpirit of the Dragon procure by that unclean ſpirit that cometh out of his mouth.</p>
               <p>For all thoſe wiſe Magicians, Aſtrologers, Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Doctors of Phyſick, are thoſe Frogs that came out of the Dragons mouth.</p>
               <p>For theſe afore-mentioned they are a great multitude, and do ſwarm as the Frogs in a warm day, and do deceive multitudes both of their health, and of their ſilver, under pretence of doing them good.</p>
               <p>This is the proper work and operation of the ſpirit or wiſdom of Reaſon, that cometh out of the Dragons mouth.</p>

               <p>SEcondly, <hi>The unclean ſpirit that cometh out of the Beaſts mouth,</hi> it is thoſe perſons that ſtudies the Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>In as much as the Beaſt is the Head of the Law, it is he that doth authorize men to be Expounders and Interpreters of the Law: he doth authorize ſome to be Judges, ſome Councellers, ſome Attorneys, with many other Titles that Lawyers have.</p>
               <p>So that this unclean ſpirit that cometh out of the Beaſts mouth, it is the multitude of Lawyers that are authorized by him, and theſe Lawyers they may be ſaid to come out of his mouth, becauſe without his power and authority they can do nothing.</p>
               <p>That is, they cannot cheat and deceive the people as they do; ſo that the Lawyers who practice Caſes of Law, they are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous that they can hardly be numbred.</p>
               <p>Alſo they are clothed with fine ſcarlet with deceiving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet the Lawyers are but the ſproutings forth of the unclean ſpirit that cometh out of the Beaſts mouth.</p>
               <p>And it is the proper work of the ſpirit of the Beaſt to clothe theſe Lawyers in ſcarlet, even as the ſpirit of the Dragon did the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62818:98"/>
Doctors of Phyſick, clothe them in Velvet, yet notwithſtanding they are in their natures no other but Frogs, ſent forth by theſe two ſpirits aforeſaid, to deceive them that dwell upon the earth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVI.</head>
               <p>THirdly, <hi>The other unclean ſpirit it came out of the mouth of the falſe prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This falſe prophet ſignifies the Chief and Head-Governor of Spiritual Worſhip, as the Pope, or any Head-Miniſter of any Religion whatſoever, but more eſpecially of that Head-Miniſter, or Head-Prieſt that is upheld by the Beaſt, or the Civil Power.</p>
               <p>For there is a ſpiritual Power inveſted upon the falſe prophet by the Beaſt, or Civil Power, ſo that none ſhall exerciſe or offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate the Office of a Miniſter, but ſuch as the falſe prophet ſhall ſend forth.</p>
               <p>So that thoſe men this falſe prophet, or chief prieſt, doth ſend forth to preach, theſe are ſent forth from that unclean ſpirit that cometh out of the falſe prophets mouth.</p>
               <p>For the falſe prophet hath full power to ordain and ſend forth men to preach, to deceive the people in a way of falſe worſhip, as the Dragon had to the Phyſician, and as the Beaſt had to the Lawyer.</p>
               <p>And as the Doctor of Phyſick by his deceit came to be clothed in Velvet, and the Lawyer by his deceit came to be clothed in Scarlet, ſo likewiſe the Preachers ordained by the falſe prophet, they come by their deceit to be clothed in ſheeps clothing, made of the fineſt wooll, with garments down to the heel.</p>
               <p>So that the outward garb and clothing of theſe three, they do carry ſuch a glory, honor, and majeſty among the people in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, that the people do believe or think there is more honor and glory within, whereby they are mightily decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their expectations.</p>
               <p>For theſe three ſorts of men afore-mentioned, are counted by the Spirit of revelation in <hi>John,</hi> no other but three ſorts of Frogs, and thoſe three ſpirits that ſent them out, they were but three unclean ſpirits.</p>
               <p>And the work theſe Frogs aforeſaid are to do, it is to go forth
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62818:99"/>
to deceive the people of the earth; for where is there a man hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found, not fourteen yeares ago upon the earth, but they were deceived either by the Phyſician, Lawyer, or Prieſt?</p>
               <p>Nay, they deceive one another; for the Prieſt is deceived by the Doctor of Phyſick, and the Doctor of Phyſick he is deceived by the Prieſt:</p>
               <p>For the Prieſt deceives his ſoul, in that the Doctor thinks he can preach ſuch ſaving Doctrine that may ſave his ſoul: but alas! he is altogether deceived; for the Prieſt doth not know what will become of his own ſoul after death, much leſs of anothers.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Doctor of Phyſick he deceives the Prieſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him believe and think that he will give him ſuch a portion of Phyſick, as ſhall reſtore him to life and health, when as many times it doth cauſe the want of health, and life both.</p>
               <p>So that he deceives the Prieſt both of his health, and money al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, juſt as the Prieſt did him in the matter of his ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And as for the Lawyer, he cheats the Doctor and the Prieſt both.</p>
               <p>For they are both forced to make uſe of him, and they do the the like by him; for the Lawyer he muſt have the Prieſt for his Miniſter to ſave his ſoul, and the Doctor to be his Phyſician.</p>
               <p>So that they get pretty even one with another, but all people beſides that deal with them, are ſure to be deceived, and to looſe by them.</p>
               <p>Theſe three ſorts of men are eſteemed by the world, the moſt honorable men of all, but by the Spirit of Faith, they are branded for the worſt of all men.</p>
               <p>In that they are called frogs, for experience doth ſhew that theſe three ſorts of men do overflow the earth, like crooking frogs in the water on a hot ſun-ſhiny day.</p>
               <p>So that hardly a man can eſcape being perſecuted, or deceived or cheated by them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are thoſe that are ſent forth by thoſe three unclean ſpirits, which are called the ſpirits of devils, which go forth to the Kings of the earth.</p>
               <p>And of the whole world to gather them together to the battel of that great Day of God Almighty.</p>
               <p>That is, theſe three ſorts of men ſhall incite and invite all ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62818:99"/>
Kings of the earth, or Head-magiſtrates, and all ignorant people to perſecute, and kill the innocent Saints, who cannot fight with no other weapons, but faith and patience.</p>
               <p>And ſuch ſpiritual weapons as theſe, muſt deſtroy all the great Army of the whole world, when they are gathered together.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this battel will be the laſt battel that will be fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Seed of Faith, and the ſeed of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Therefore called the great day of God Almighty: and the place where this great battel muſt be fought, where they were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, it is called in the Hebrew tongue <hi>Armageddon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſignifies the whole world, or that great City myſtery <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the mother of harlots, who hath made all nations drink of the cup of the wine of the wrath of her fornications.</p>
               <p>When that City is deſtroyed, the whole world will be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more of that in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, ſo that the Reader may ſee a little more clear what is meant by thoſe three unclean ſpirits like frogs, what they are, and from whom they did proceed.</p>
               <p>Alſo I have interpreted what followed upon the pouring out of the vial of the ſixth Angel, with many other things which may ſatisfie the Readers ſpirit, if underſtood.</p>
               <p>So I ſhall paſs by a verſe or two, there being nothing of any great concernment in them, and ſhall go on to the 17 verſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANd the ſeventh Angel poured his vial into the air, and there came a great voice out of the Temple of heaven from the Throne, ſaying, It is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſeventh Angel he poured out his vial into the air.</p>
               <p>Now this is to be minded, that the vials of Gods wrath they are poured out upon the earth, and upon the ſea, and upon the Sun, and upon the ſeat of the beaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now laſt of all upon the air, ſo that the wrath of God is poured out upon every thing, and place, that doth yield comfort and refreſhment unto the heart of man.</p>
               <p>And air being the greateſt refreſhment of life of any thing elſe,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62818:100"/>
eſpecially when life is like to die, this experience doth ſhew the truth of it.</p>
               <p>Alſo air is the laſt refuge that life hath to fly unto, for many people will in ſickneſs call for air, becauſe for want of they it die; for air, is the life of nature, and when life is weak, and not ſtrong enough, to take in air into it, then it doth dye, for ſo long as life can receive air into it, it doth live.</p>
               <p>So that this ſeventh and laſt vial of Gods wrath, it is poured out upon the air.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the air is the laſt, and greateſt refreſhment unto a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, and not onely ſo, but it is the concluſion of life the want of it.</p>
               <p>So that the laſt vial of Gods wrath, it is poured out into the air, onely to ſignifie the annihilation of all natural life, which he created at the beginning of this world.</p>
               <p>So now at the latter end of this world, his vial of wrath being poured out upon, or into the air, it will deſtroy that natural life of man and beaſt, and all other creatures that hath life.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that great voice out of the Temple of heaven from the Throne, ſaying, It is done.</p>
               <p>Signifying that the vial of Gods wrath being poured into the air, is the concluſion and end of all Gods plagues, upon natural life in this world.</p>
               <p>For though God had deſtroyed the life of many thouſands and millions, more then can be numbered by thoſe ſix vials poured out before, as that of the earth, and of the ſea, and of the ſun, and of the ſeat of the beaſt, as aforeſaid,</p>
               <p>I ſay, they are not to be numbered the multitude theſe vials did deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Yet this vial poured out into the air, it deſtroyeth more then all the reſt.</p>
               <p>It being the laſt, and the utter annihilation of all natural life, and the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid by the voice out of the Temple in heaven, It is done.</p>
               <p>That is, all the vials of Gods wrath are poured forth upon this wicked, unbelieving, idolatrous world, neither ſhall there be any more vials of wrath, or plagues poured out upon men any more to eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:62818:100"/>For that voice <hi>John heard out of the temple in heaven from the throne, it was from no other but from God himſelf, ſaying, It is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And immediately upon that voice, <hi>there were other voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and there was a great earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the earth, ſo mighty an earthquake, and ſo great,</hi> as you may ſee verſe 18.</p>
               <p>This 18, 19, 20, 21. verſes, have all of them relation to the end of the world, which thing will be done in the pouring out of the vial of the ſeventh Angel; which ſeventh Angel is now pouring out his vial of wrath upon the men of this world.</p>
               <p>For as the ſeventh and laſt Anti-Angel, namely the <hi>Quakers</hi> miniſtery doth ſound, and hath ſounded neer upon twenty years, ſo likewiſe the ſeventh vial hath been poured out this twenty years alſo.</p>
               <p>And, it will laſt pouring out to the end of time, even as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Anti-angels miniſtery will laſt to the end of the world, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And as I ſaid before, much like unto thoſe Plagues that <hi>Moſes</hi> brought unto <hi>Egypt,</hi> God will bring upon the earth, upon the ſea, upon the ſun, and upon the air, at the end of the world.</p>
               <p>And as there was a great hail in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo that the Egyptians blaſphemed God, becauſe of the plague of the hail.</p>
               <p>Even ſo will it be in the end of the world, when thoſe great voices of the four and twenty Elders, the four beaſts, the holy Angels, and Saints ſhall utter their voice in <hi>Allelujahs</hi> unto God their King and Redeemer, it will be as the voice of thunders, and lightnings, and will cauſe a mighty great hail, every ſtone the weight of a talent.</p>
               <p>That is, God will rain down fire and brimſtone upon the earth, and ſea, ſun, and air, ſo that none of theſe four, which is the life of all creatures, ſhall yield refreſhment to the mind of man, but it ſhall rain ſtones of fire mingled with brimſtone, which cannot be diſſolved.</p>
               <p>So that men ſhall blaſpheme God eternally, becauſe of the hail, it being exceeding great.</p>
               <p>It muſt needs be exceeding great becauſe it is eternal, it being the laſt plague, or laſt vial of Gods wrath, it being the end of all time, there being now nothing but eternal miſery to remain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:62818:101"/>For there will fall upon every wicked mans ſoul, whoſe names are not written in the book of Life, ſuch an hail-ſtone of fire and brimſtone, that ſhall weigh a talent.</p>
               <p>That is, it ſhall weigh ſo heavy upon his heart, that it ſhall preſs his ſoul down into the ſecond death, which is eternal.</p>
               <p>So much for the interpretation of the chief matters in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter of <hi>Johns Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="58" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. LVIII.</head>
               <p>IN the ſixteenth chapter of <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> it doth propheſie of the ſeven laſt plagues that God will pour out upon this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, unbelieving, idolatrous world.</p>
               <p>Much like unto thoſe plagues <hi>Moſes</hi> poured out upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> at the beginning of his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe will God pour out the vials of his wrath upon the earth, at the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Which will be at the end of the Commiſſion of the Spirit. Now what theſe ſeven vials are, I have opened in the 16 chapter.</p>
               <p>Now this 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter it doth contain a propheſie of the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of the ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> or myſtery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is compared by the ſpirit in <hi>John,</hi> to a woman arrayed in ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, to an adulterous woman, to a whore, to a great city.</p>
               <p>Now this is to be minded by the Reader, that there is two <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> ſpoken of in Scripture, two ſorts of whores, two ſorts of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, two ſorts of Cities, two ſorts of Vials of Gods wrath, to be poured out upon the earth.</p>
               <p>That is, there is a temporal <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Hiſtory, and <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Myſtery, or a natural fornication of the fleſh with woman, and a ſpiritual fornication in the ſoul and minde of man with idols.</p>
               <p>And ſo the one is called a whore, or an adulterous woman in the temporal, and the other is called a whore in the ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>So that there is two ſorts of whores, and two ſorts of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; likewiſe there is two ſorts of Cities, that is, a temporal City, and a ſpiritual City.</p>
               <p>The temporal City is that which the reaſon of man hath built for its own glory, of wood, and ſtone, guilded with Silver and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62818:101"/>
Gold, the ſpiritual City is that which God hath built, which is the body of man.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>Your bodies are the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo likewiſe the believing Jews and Gentiles, they are called by the Spirit the holy City, ſo that there is a ſpiritual holy City, and there is a ſpiritual unholy City.</p>
               <p>That is, there is true worſhippers of God, and falſe worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God, a myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> a myſtery of Gods temporal Plagues, and ſpiritual Plagues.</p>
               <p>To ſum up all the meaning of <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> is this, that all the true Believers both Jews and Gentiles, that doth worſhip God according to the tennor of that Commiſſion they are under, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the worſhip of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the worſhip of the Goſpel of Jeſus, ſet up by his Apoſtles, or the worſhip of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſet up by the Witneſſes of the Spirit,</p>
               <p>Theſe three being all Commiſſionated of God, ſo that who ever doth truly believe in theſe three Commiſſions in their time, and place, when they were in being upon the earth, I ſay they are all counted by the Spirit but one City, or one woman, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.1. <hi>A woman clothed with the ſun, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So on the contrary, all falſe worſhip that is ſet up by non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated men, who doth reſemble or imitate the true worſhip ſet up by true commiſſionated men,</p>
               <p>I ſay, thoſe men having no Commiſſion from God ſo to do, their worſhip is meer idolatry, and all thoſe people who joyn in that worſhip ſo ſet up, they are all idolatrous people.</p>
               <p>And ſo counted by the Spirit in <hi>John</hi> that great City <hi>Babylon,</hi> in oppoſition to the holy City of God, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>So that this is to be minded by the Reader, that there is but two Cities, that is to ſay, the City of Saints, and the great city of devils.</p>
               <p>That is, all true worſhippers are called the holy City, and all falſe worſhippers are called by the Spirit, the great City <hi>Babylon,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe they are all called but one woman, or one whore.</p>
               <p>So that you that have any true light in your underſtandings, you may ſee that all the meſſengers of idolatry, and all idolatrous people, they are called by the Spirit but one whore, or one fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62818:102"/>So that look what worſhip hath been ſet up by a non-commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated man at the firſt,</p>
               <p>In that they did imitate <hi>Moſes</hi> in his worſhip, and ſo afterwards did imitate the Apoſtles worſhip, without a Commiſſion from God.</p>
               <p>I ſay, that the firſt brothers, or imitators of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Apoſtles worſhip, with all the adherents thereunto, and the multitudes of people that are deceived by them, who were the firſt brothers of this idolatrous worſhip ſet up by non-commiſſionated men,</p>
               <p>I ſay they are all counted by the ſpirit but a whore, in that they and all people who doth joyn in worſhip with them, they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication in their ſpirits with idols.</p>
               <p>So that who ever doth worſhip falſe gods, by the inſtigation of the falſe prophet, or falſe prieſt, he doth commit fornication or whoredom with idols.</p>
               <p>So that this is to be minded, that all opinions in worſhip that people are in, who hath not a true Commiſſion from God to be a Miniſter, or Preacher, he and they do all commit fornication with idols.</p>
               <p>For every opinion in religion that doth not worſhip the true God, they do commit fornication with idols.</p>
               <p>Neither can they do otherways, becauſe their teachers are falſe, like prieſt, like people.</p>
               <p>Alſo this is to be obſerved by the Reader, that the Revelation of the Spirit, it hath onely relation to thoſe peoples that do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and confeſs the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Johns Revelation</hi> hath relation to all thoſe that confeſs the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, and the Goſpel of Jeſus, and the Apoſtles, and not relating to the heathen, who never heard of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>So that all thoſe falſe worſhippers under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all thoſe falſe worſhippers under the Goſpel of Jeſus, they are called by the ſpirit that great City <hi>Babylon,</hi> or myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> or a ſcarlet whore.</p>
               <p>It is called myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> in relation to the myſtery of God, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe it may be called myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> in relation to that <hi>Babel</hi> that men would have built, that ſhould have reached up
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62818:102"/>
to heaven after <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, in reſpect of the confuſion there was in the building of it, ſo that it all came to utter confuſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe there is ſuch a confuſion in all falſe worſhip and worſhippers, that at the laſt that <hi>Babylon</hi> they have built with idols, thinking to reach in that ſuperſtitious way up to heaven,</p>
               <p>But they ſhall be confuſed in their underſtandings, and in the true knowledge and worſhip of the true God.</p>
               <p>So that they ſhall be utterly deſtroyed, both them and their <hi>Babel,</hi> that is their worſhip, with an eternal deſtruction.</p>
               <p>But this is to be minded, that the firſt mention of this temporal <hi>Babel, Geneſ.</hi> 11.4. where the ſons of <hi>Noah ſaid, Go to, let us build us a City, and a Tower, whoſe top may reach unto heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the ſeventh verſe, God conſumed this tower by confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their language.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the firſt riſe of this myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> it was amongſt the Jews.</p>
               <p>That is, when the Jews would worſhip other gods, beſides that God which <hi>Moſes</hi> did declare unto them, even the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to wit, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thoſe Jews who were the ſeed of the ſerpent, they would have other gods, as the <hi>Amorites</hi> and the heathen had, to go before them.</p>
               <p>Therefore they would have a Calf to be their God to worſhip, as <hi>Exodus</hi> chapter 32.1. this Calf was the firſt falſe god the people of the Jews did worſhip.</p>
               <p>Though they murmured againſt God, and <hi>Moſes</hi> many times before, yet they never fell to worſhip idols as Gods, before.</p>
               <p>So that this was the firſt beginning of the ſetting up, or the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a falſe worſhip, in oppoſition to that worſhip that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet up, which was but a little before.</p>
               <p>So that as ſoon as ever God did ſet up his worſhip by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the people might come to know the true God,</p>
               <p>I ſay the ſpirit of reaſon, which is the devil in man, he doth ſet up his worſhip in like manner to worſhip gods of his own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even the works of his own hands, even a Calf.</p>
               <p>For this Calf doth ſignifie all idols, or falſe worſhip whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:62818:103"/>For though the idols of men are many, and their forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip many, yet they all being falſe, not worſhipping the true God, they do but worſhip a calf in ſtead of God.</p>
               <p>And as theſe Jews who made this calf for a God, were the firſt that began to build up a <hi>Babel</hi> of falſe worſhip, this ſpirit of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry it did run thorow the line of the ſeed of the ſerpent, until it got great power.</p>
               <p>For after <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were gone, the ſeed of the ſerpent grew in great power, and did puniſh thoſe that would not bow down to <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Baal</hi> ſignifies all falſe worſhip, or all falſe gods, ſo that when the ſerpents ſeed got power to ſet up his worſhip, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had power to ſet up the worſhip of God,</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Moſes</hi> did plague and puniſh thoſe ſerpents for making that calf, and worſhipping it, or any other idols, in that many of them were deſtroyed by death,</p>
               <p>So hath the falſe worſhippers ſerved the Prophets, and Saints ever ſince, that would not bow down to their falſe worſhip: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, and <hi>Ahab, Manaſſes,</hi> with divers other wicked kings, and rulers, and head-magiſtrates in the time of the Law, who perſecuted the Prophets, and put them to death.</p>
               <p>For telling them of their forſaking of the worſhip of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and worſhipping of idols.</p>
               <p>And the ſame ſpirit of reaſon, the devil, it continued in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews until Chriſt came, according to that propheſie of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſcepter ſhall not depart from <hi>Judah</hi> until <hi>Shiloh</hi> come.</p>
               <p>So that there was a Scepter of Government that did remain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people of the Jews, though they had no Jews kings a long time before.</p>
               <p>So that a matter of forty years after Chriſts death, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Scepter did depart from <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, from that nation of the Jews, ſo that they are ever ſince a ſcattered people in many parts of the earth.</p>
               <p>So that the Scepter, that is, the Government is departed from them indeed, and the ſame ſpirit of perſecution, and idolatry it doth run along in the ſeed of reaſon, the devil, in the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>So that the Gentile Kings and Head magiſtrates have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62818:103"/>
mightily to idolatry, imitating the worſhip of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And hath perſecuted and put to death, many Saints for not bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to that worſhip ſet up by theſe Gentile-Kings, or Head-magiſtrates, ever ſince the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even to this day.</p>
               <p>So that this is to be minded by the Reader, that this myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> or great city, or whore, who hath committed fornication with the Kings of the earth.</p>
               <p>The meaning of the Spirit is this, that all Kings and Head-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Goſpel, who profeſs the Scriptures even to the end of the world,</p>
               <p>That have, or ſhall ſet up a falſe worſhip, or idols by their power, and cauſe the people to do the ſame, they may be ſaid to commit fornication with idols.</p>
               <p>So that whoever doth worſhip falſe gods, let it be in what form or manner it will, it is all counted by the ſpirit but ſpiritual fornication or whoredom.</p>
               <p>So that all falſe worſhippers, or all that do worſhip idols, or falſe gods, from the greateſt to the leaſt, from the beginning of <hi>Moſes</hi> Commiſſion, to the beginning of the Apoſtles Commiſſion, and to the end of them: and not onely ſo, but to the end of the world, even to the end of the Commiſſion of the Spirit, even the ſeven Churches of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all ſpiritual idolatrous worſhip is in them alſo, though they differ in ſeveral forms of worſhip one from another.</p>
               <p>Namely, the <hi>Papiſt, Epiſcopacy, Presbyterian, Independent, Baptiſt, Ranter,</hi> and <hi>Quaker,</hi> all other Sects and Opinions are involved in theſe ſeven, and every one of theſe ſeven are idolatrous.</p>
               <p>Becauſe none of them knoweth the true God, therefore cannot worſhip him aright.</p>
               <p>So that by conſequence it will follow, that they all commit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with idols; for whoever worſhips a falſe god, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſpiritual fornication, which I am ſure they all do.</p>
               <p>For neither the Miniſtery of them, nor the people, doth know the true God nor the right devil, for if they did, then would they know what worſhip doth belong unto the true God now in theſe latter dayes.</p>
               <p>So that all the falſe worſhippers from the beginning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to

               <p>IN the firſt verſe of this ſeventeenth Chapter, there was one of the ſeven Angels which had the ſeven vials, and talked with <hi>John</hi> by way of viſion and revelation, ſaying unto him, <hi>Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I will ſhew unto thee the judgement of the great Whore that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon many waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it is clear that <hi>John</hi> did ſee by way of viſion and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the downfal or judgement of this great ſpiritual Whore, which I have ſhewed what is meant by it before.</p>
               <p>And as for her ſitting upon many waters, the many waters where the whore ſitteth, it ſignifies multitudes of people, nations, and tongues, as you may ſee verſe 15.</p>
               <p>That is, the ſpirit of reaſon in the whore, as aforeſaid, ſhould
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62818:104"/>
have ſuch a ſpiritual power over the ſpirits of whole nations, and tongues, and multitudes of people, that ſhe ſhould cauſe them all to commit fornication with idols, or elſe they ſhould be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſuffer death.</p>
               <p>So that whoſoever would not commit fornication with her, or at her command, they ſhould drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
               <p>That is, ſhe would perſecute and put them to death; for death is the wine of her wrath.</p>
               <p>For the blood of the Saints is that wine of her wrath, which is put into her golden cup that is in her hand.</p>
               <p>And ſhe doth not onely drink the blood of the Saints, that is, in the golden cup her ſelf, but ſhe doth make the Kings of the earth to drink it alſo.</p>
               <p>For in the a verſe, <hi>With whom the kings of the earth have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk of the wine of her fornication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, the Kings of the earth hath committed fornication with her, in that they have been perſwaded by her, and joyned with her to worſhip idols.</p>
               <p>For except the Kings of the earth, who are the temporal power, doth joyn with her ſpiritual power, ſhe could do nothing.</p>
               <p>So that the Kings of the earth committing fornication with her, that is, to worſhip idols with her.</p>
               <p>So they came to commit fornication with her, that is, the Kings and Head-magiſtrates doth uphold that ſpiritual power the whore hath, and doth help to make the people to drink of the wine of her fornication.</p>
               <p>So that the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>
               <p>That is, the inhabitants of the earth, what with command from the ſpiritual power of the whore, and what with command from the temporal power of the Kings of the earth, the inhabitants of the earth are forced to commit fornication with idols alſo.</p>
               <p>So that they are made to drink the wine of fornication with her, that is, look what comfort or ſatisfaction can be found in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of idols, they ſhall drink it with her.</p>
               <p>But the wrath of her fornication, none ſhall drink that but the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62818:105"/>
Saints, becauſe they will not commit fornication with her, that is to ſay, not worſhip idols at her command.</p>
               <p>Verſe the 3. <hi>So be carried me away in the ſpirit into the wilderneſs, and I ſaw a Woman ſit upon a Scarlet coloured beaſt, full of names of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, having ſeven heads, and ten horns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the wilderneſs, I ſhall ſay nothing as to that, becauſe I have opened what it is in <hi>the Interpretation of the eleventh of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Woman who doth ſit upon a Scarlet coloured beaſt, the Woman is the ſame, as I ſaid before, that great City <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Scarlet coloured beaſt, it doth ſignifie all Kings and Head-magiſtrates, who hath ſubmitted unto the falſe ſuggeſtions of Learned men, who have pretended to be Prophets, and Prieſts, and Miniſters of God, without a Commiſſion from God.</p>
               <p>And ſo by the advice of theſe falſe prophets, prieſts, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, kings, and head-magiſtrates, hath ſet up images or forms of worſhip,</p>
               <p>And hath made Laws for all people to obey in point of worſhip, as well as in point of civil or temporal affairs.</p>
               <p>Alſo they have made theſe perſons aforeſaid, to have the charge to ſee the people worſhip according to that Law.</p>
               <p>And hath given them a ſpiritual power to puniſh all thoſe that will not worſhip accordingly.</p>
               <p>This hath been the practice of all Kings and Head-magiſtrates; I mean all evil kings and head-magiſtrates, ever ſince the firſt idolatrous practices was uſed under <hi>Moſes</hi> Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And ſo a ſucceſſive idolatrous power did follow, even amongſt the profeſſors of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was practiſed by many wicked kings and head-magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and falſe prieſts, and falſe prophets,</p>
               <p>Which did cauſe many true Prophets, and righteous men to be perſecuted and put to death, for not giving way to their falſe worſhip.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſince the Apoſtles Commiſſion, the ſame thing hath been acted by Kings, and Prieſts, and ſo it will be to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>So that all evil kings and evil head-magiſtrates, are counted by the Spirit, but one ſcarlet coloured beaſt; for the ſpiritual Whore,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62818:105"/>
the woman to ſit upon: ſhe may be ſaid to ſit upon the beaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe fits upon his power, for Kings in all ages have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſpiritual power, though it hath been never ſo falſe; for we ſee by experience that all thoſe that goeth upon a ſpiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if he be but a Miniſter of the Goſpel ſo called, yet he ſits upon the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>For where is there a Magiſtrate in a Pariſh as a Deputy, or ſuch like, but the Miniſter ſits upon him?</p>
               <p>So that one can do nothing as to matter of worſhip without the other.</p>
               <p>So that the idolatrous woman who is the chief, may well be ſaid to ſit upon a ſcarlet coloured beaſt, which beaſt ſignifies all Kings and Head-magiſtrates, who give themſelves up to be guided in matter of worſhip by non-commiſſionated men, who pretend a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power to be Prophets, Prieſts, or Miniſters of the Goſpel, or of the Law, without a Commiſſion from God.</p>
               <p>But this beaſt here ſpoken of by <hi>John,</hi> it doth chiefly relate to thoſe beaſts that did ſucceed after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was a matter of four years after Chriſts death, in relation to thoſe Ten Perſecutions, which did laſt a matter of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.</p>
               <p>So that all thoſe beaſts that perſecuted the Saints in that time, they are called by the Spirit <hi>a ſcarlet coloured beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He may be called a ſcarlet coloured beaſt, in regard he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the woman with his temporal power, to perſecute and ſhed the blood of Saints.</p>
               <p>So that the ſins of his ſoul, they were as red as ſcarlet with the blood of the Saints, and in this ſenſe he is called a ſcarlet coloured beaſt, and not onely ſo, but full of names of blaſphemy, having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads, and ten horns.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, ſo many heads, ſo many names of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that is, there was ſeven Kings that came out of his loins, as I ſhewed power, and all theſe ſeven heads, or beaſts, they perſecuted and ſhed the blood of Saints, and blaſphemed God that had power over Plagues.</p>
               <p>So that they all blaſphemed God, and ſhed the blood of the Saints, for not worſhipping their images, and in this regard he may be called a ſcarlet coloured beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy.</p>

               <p>VErſe the fourth, <hi>And the woman was arrayed in Purple, and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-colour, and decked with Gold, and precious Stores and Pearls, having a golden Cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthineſs of her fornication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This woman is the ſame afore-mentioned, and as for her being arrayed in Purple, and ſcarlet-colour: the purple ſignifies the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil outſide appearance, and rich array.</p>
               <p>That is, ſhe was arrayed with ſuch outſide language and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and ornaments concerning the worſhipping of Idols,</p>
               <p>That it was as a garment of purple unto her, which made the Kings and people all to bow down to her, and glad they were that they might drink of that golden cup in her hand, which cup was full of abomination.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſcarlet-colour, ſhe was decked with that is within her.</p>
               <p>That is, her ſoul was made as red as ſcarlet, with the blood of the Saints, as the beaſt aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And as for the precious Stones and Pearls ſhe was decked with, that ſignifies that good eſteem the beaſt and the people had of her ſuperſtitious worſhip,</p>
               <p>Thinking in themſelves that ſhe was precious in the eyes of the Lord, or as a Pearl, or Jewel in the ſight of God, and that ſhe did God good ſervice to kill his Saints, that would not bow down and worſhip ſo holy a ſervice as was required by her.</p>
               <p>And as for the golden Cup in her hand, the Cup ſignifies the form and manner of worſhip, which ſhe doth preſcribe to the beaſt, and the people, to falſe gods.</p>
               <p>And that which this golden Cup in her hand is full with, it is the ſuperſtitious idolatrous worſhip, that the beaſt and people muſt drink of.</p>
               <p>That is, they muſt do as ſhe hath preſcribed in matter of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

and ſo they come to drink out of the golden Cup in her hand, and ſo they take a full draught of her ſpiritual abominations and filthineſs of her fornications with idols, and in the blood of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Verſe the fifth, <hi>And upon her head was a name written, Myſtery,</hi> Babylon <hi>the great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There need not be any interpretation upon this verſe, for I have ſhewed what is meant by <hi>Babylon</hi> before, and what is meant by the mother of harlots, ſo that I ſhall paſs by this 5 verſe, and proceed to the 6 verſe.</p>
               <p>Verſe the ſixth, <hi>And I ſaw the Woman drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus, and when I ſaw her, I wondered with great admiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion the Woman drunken with the blood of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>That is, myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> or City <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is compared to a woman, that is, all perſecuting Spirits in point of worſhip are compared to a woman.</p>
               <p>For they have all drunk the blood of Saints and Martyrs, ſo that <hi>John</hi> did ſee in his viſion, that they were all drunken with the blood of Saints, even as men are drunken with wine.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>John</hi> did wonder with great admiration, to ſee that God ſhould have ſo much patience, as to ſtay ſo long before he did pour out his Judgements upon this Woman, who had made her ſelf drunken with the blood of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But in the ſeventh verſe, <hi>The Angel ſaid unto</hi> John, <hi>wherefore didſt thou marvel? I will tell thee the myſtery of the woman, and of the beaſt that carrieth her, which hath the ſeven heads, and ten horns.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:62818:107"/>But the explanation of the Angel, it is as dark to the reaſon of man, as the viſion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>For who can underſtand what is meant by theſe words, verſe the eighth, <hi>the beaſt that thou ſaweſt, was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſs pit, and go into perdition, and they that dwell upon the earth ſhall wonder, whoſe names were not written in the book of life, from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beaſt, that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet by the Revelation of the Spirit of Faith, I ſhall open the meaning of <hi>Johns</hi> words.</p>
               <p>The Reader may remember that I gave a touch of it in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the thirteenth chapter, where I have ſhewed the difference between the dragons ſeven heads, and ten horns, and the Beaſts ſeven heads, and ten horns.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, the Dragons ſeven heads, did ſignifie ſeven Kings beſides himſelf</p>
               <p>And the beaſt that the Dragon did give his ſeat, power, and authority unto, who had ſeven heads, and ten horns,</p>
               <p>I declare his own head was one of the ſeven, and the firſt head of the ſeven, that did exerciſe the power of the Dragon.</p>
               <p>So that this Dragon <hi>Herod</hi> that perſecuted the woman, he is that beaſt that was, and is not.</p>
               <p>That is, he was alive in his own perſon, when he would have ſlain Chriſt with the young children.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing he was prevented in that, and could not devour the young childe Jeſus, he perſecuted the woman, and the remnant of her ſeed.</p>
               <p>That is, all true believers in that childe Jeſus, they were the remnant of her ſeed.</p>
               <p>But the earth help the woman, and ſwallowed up the flood.</p>
               <p>That is, the young children that were ſlain by the Dragons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, are called by the ſpirit the earth, and their deaths did ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up the flood of perſecuti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, that came out of the Dragons mouth.</p>
               <p>And this is the beaſt that was, and is not: that is, he is dead and the other beaſt that had ſeven heads, and ten horns, he is that ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-coloured beaſt that the woman doth ſit upon.</p>
               <p>That is, all the ſeven heads that this beaſt, had his own being one,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62818:107"/>
they did exerciſe the power of the Dragon in perſecuting the Saints, which was the remnant of the ſeed of the woman, whom the Dragon did perſecute.</p>
               <p>Now this is to be minded by the Reader, that the ſpirit of the Dragon, it did remain in the ſeed of reaſon, that was in thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads, or ſeven beaſts, though the Dragon which is the eight was dead, as to his outward appearance.</p>
               <p>Neither did that viſible body of the Dragon appear any more, but that ſpirit of his ſeed, it was in his ſons ſeed, ſo that the ſame ſpirit of the Dragon it did run thorow the ſeed of reaſon, thorow the line of thoſe ſeven beaſts.</p>
               <p>And did cauſe them to perſecute, and ſhed the blood of the Saints as he did, and would have done.</p>
               <p>This was chiefly with relation to thoſe Ten Perſecutions, in the time of the Apoſtles Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And as for the Beaſt that was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſs-pit, and go into perdition.</p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that the ſame ſpirit of reaſon, that was in the Dragon, who was that beaſt that was, and is not,</p>
               <p>I ſay, the ſame ſpirit of perſecution ſhall aſcend out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-pit of the imagination of reaſon, that is, in the other beaſts that ſucceeded the dragon;</p>
               <p>For all wicked beaſts were, and are guided by one ſpirit, even the ſpirit of the devil, which devil is no other but the ſpirit of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in man.</p>
               <p>And the imagination that floweth from this ſpirit of reaſon, it is that bottomleſs pit.</p>
               <p>So that this beaſt that did aſcend out of the bottomleſs-pit, it was no other but the ſpirit of reaſon that did aſcend out of the hearts of thoſe ſeven beaſts aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Which cauſed them to exerciſe the power of the Dragon, in perſecuting and ſheding the blood of the Saints, and ſo at the end of the world they go into perdition.</p>
               <p>For this is to be minded, that when a wicked man doth go into perdition, he doth never return again, becauſe it is an eternal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>This is to be minded alſo, that the bottomleſs-pit is one thing, and perditon is another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:62818:108"/>For almoſt all men are in the bottomleſs-pit of their own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, onely thoſe that know truth.</p>
               <p>Yet mens ſpirits of reaſon may aſcend out of the bottomleſs-pit of their vain imaginations, and come to know truth, but after the ſpirit of a man goeth into perdition, there is no poſſibility ever to aſcend out of that, becauſe it is eternal.</p>
               <p>Again it is ſaid, <hi>And they that dwell on the earth ſhall wonder, whoſe names were not written in the book of Life, from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi>

               <p>So that it did ſeem to ignorant people to be the ſame beaſt, and that the Dragon beaſt was riſen again, which made them to wonder to behold that beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is.</p>
               <p>When as it was no other but the Dragons ſpirit, in the ſeed which acted it ſelf forth in the perſon of another beaſt, much like unto the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>For they know that ſpirits cannot ſlip out of the bodies, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume other bodies, but that ſpirit muſt die with the body.</p>
               <p>Onely there is a ſpirit remaineth in the ſeed, that is in another, that may act cruelties like his, or more worſe, but not in the ſame perſon: ſo was it with this beaſt, that was, and is not, and yet is, and fo forth.</p>

               <p>VErſe the nineth, <hi>And here is the mind which hath wiſdom, the the ſeven heads are ſeven Mountains, on which the woman ſitteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This verſe is a beginning of the interpretation of <hi>Johns</hi> viſion, and of the beaſt, and of the woman, and ſo the interpretation go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the end of the chapter.</p>
               <p>For this muſt be minded, that <hi>John</hi> ſaw theſe things by viſion and revelation when he was in the Iſle of <hi>Patmots</hi> a baniſhed man, before theſe things were acted upon this earth, which maketh his writings the more hard to underſtand, and much more hard to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete.</p>
               <p>So that it muſt needs be true wiſdom to know the minde of the Spirit in theſe myſtical ſayings of his.</p>
               <p>Yet the revelation of Faith hath underſtood, and given the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of moſt of the chief things of concernment in the book of <hi>Johns Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeven heads are called by the Spirit, ſeven Mountains on which the woman fitteth.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeven Mountains are thoſe ſeven Beaſts ſpoken of before, though called here ſeven Mountains.</p>
               <p>And as for the woman, I have ſhewed what is meant by it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit, all ſpiritual power in relation to the worſhipping of falſe gods, it being ſet up by non-commiſſionated men, and all falſe worſhippers they are called by the Spirit, a woman, or the great City <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that thoſe chief men that have ſet up forms of worſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Commiſſion from God, they are called the woman that ſitteth on ſeven Mountains.</p>
               <p>She may be ſaid to fit upon them, becauſe her ſpiritual idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous power is above their temporal power.</p>
               <p>For, as I ſaid before, the temporal Magiſtrate is commonly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Prieſt, eſpecially in matters of religion, ſo that in this regard the woman may be ſaid to fit upon ſeven Mountains.</p>
               <p>For ſhe had power over all theſe ſeven Beaſts, to cauſe them to commit ſpiritual fornication, and ſpiritual whoredom with her in worſhipping of falſe gods, and in ſheding the blood of Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:62818:109"/>Verſe the tenth, <hi>And there are ſeven Kings, five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come, and when he cometh, he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his viſion, that five of theſe ſeven perſecuting beaſts were fallen.</p>
               <p>And he, that one, is in preſent being in the time of the Apoſtles Commiſſion, and that was the ſixth.</p>
               <p>And the other that was not yet come, he was to come after the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles was exterpated out of the world, and when he is come, he ſhall continue a ſhort ſpace.</p>
               <p>That is, he ſhall not continue to the end of the world, for no man knoweth what the ſpirit doth mean by a ſhort ſpace, but the ſpirit of the beaſt that was, and is not, he ſhall continue to the end of the world, as in the eleventh verſe, <hi>And the beaſt that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the ſeven, and goeth into perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that the ſpirit of the Dragon <hi>Herod,</hi> the beaſt who is the eighth, though of the ſeven wicked beaſts, becauſe they all acted by his wicked ſpirit of reaſon, the devil.</p>
               <p>So that the ſpirit of the Dragon, it ſhall run thorow the loins of all perſecuting Kings and Head-magiſtrates, even to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Hath not the ſpirit of perſecution run thorow the loins of many Papiſt Kings, by the power of the Popes ſpiritual fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince the worſhip of the Goſpel was ſet up by him all over <hi>Europe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hath not the ſpirit of ſpiritual fornication to worſhip falſe gods, run thorow the loins of the <hi>Papiſts, Proteſtant, Presbytery, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Baptiſt, Ranter,</hi> and <hi>Quaker,</hi> all over <hi>Europe,</hi> or as we call it <hi>Chriſtendom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this ſpiritual fornication all opinions doth commit with idols, or in worſhipping of falſe gods.</p>
               <p>So that they all make up but one woman, or one whore, who commiteth ſp ritual fornication, or one great City <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe there hath many Papiſt Kings, ſince the Pope had this ſpiritual power, that have been guilty of ſheding the blood of Martyrs, more then can well be numbered.</p>
               <p>Neither can all Proteſtant Kings be excuſed in this point, nor Presbytery neither.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:62818:109"/>Neither would the other four be excuſable, if they were in power.</p>
               <p>So that the ſpirit of the Dragon it doth, and hath run thorow the loins of all theſe beaſts that have been ſince the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion was ſet up.</p>
               <p>So that all the perſecution that hath been for conſcience ſake, all the blood that hath been ſhed for Religion ſake, it hath been acted from the ſpirit of the whore aforeſaid, in the Prieſts, and from the ſpirit of the Dragon in the Head-magiſtrate, who are called beaſts.</p>
               <p>And this ſpirit hath raigned, and doth raign in the Head-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ever ſince the Roman Catholick Religion was ſet up, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> aforeſaid, and ſhall continue to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>They all being counted by the ſpirit but one beaſt, becauſe they are all guided by one ſpirit of perſecution and blood-ſhed, for Religion ſake.</p>
               <p>So that I declare, that this is the beaſt that was, and is not, even he is the eight, and is of the ſeventh:</p>
               <p>That is, his ſpirit runs thorow the ſeed of the ſeventh, and ſo it doth run thorow the bodies of theſe that are the eighth.</p>
               <p>So that this ſpirit of the dragon, which is reaſon the devil, who hath perſecuted, and ſhed the blood of Saints &amp; Martyrs of Jeſus, for not worſhipping falſe gods, that they may all go into perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together, that is, into eternal damnation.</p>

               <p>VErſe the twelfth, <hi>And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt are ten Kings, which have received no kingdom as yet, but receive power as kings one hour with the beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ten Kings were inferior to the Beaſt, and were under his Dominions; for the Beaſt was as it were an Emperor, who had many Kings under him.</p>
               <p>And theſe ten Kings lived in kingdoms, but were not ſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed as that they could keep them againſt the Beaſts will, yet nevertheleſs if they would be obedient unto the Beaſt, and execute his will, he would give them power as Kings one hour with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that was until they had extirpated the name of Jeſus out of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:62818:110"/>And that power they received of the beaſt, it was to perſecute and kill the Saints;</p>
               <p>For theſe ten Kings were thoſe ten horns upon the beaſt, that had ſeven heads.</p>
               <p>That is, theſe ten Kings ſhould receive power from the beaſt, to execute thoſe ten Perſecutions upon the Saints.</p>
               <p>Yet I would not have the Reader to think that there was but ten Kings, and no more, for ten Kings did not laſt 300 years.</p>
               <p>But if there were ten ſcore Kings, the ſpirit doth call them but ten, ſignifying thoſe ten perſecutions in the primitive times.</p>
               <p>For the beaſt had ſeven heads and ten horns, and theſe ten Kings were thoſe ten horns, and they received their power to perſecute, and ſhed the blood of Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus, from the ſeven heads, which is called a beaſt.</p>
               <p>So that the one hour that theſe ten Kings received power from the beaſt, it was all the time of the Ten Perſecutions, for they were the ten horns as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>This you may ſee in the thirteenth verſe, <hi>Theſe have one mind, and ſhall give their power and ſtrengh unto the beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, ſeing the beaſt had given them power as Kings, to ſhed the blood of Saints, they likewiſe proffer unto the beaſt their power and ſtrength to ſerve him, in what they can.</p>
               <p>And the ſervice theſe ten Kings muſt do the beaſt, it is to ſhed the blood of the Saints, as you may ſee in the fourteenth verſe.</p>
               <p>Verſe the fourteenth, <hi>Theſe ſhall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of Kings, and they that are with him, are called, and choſen, and faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ten Kings aforeſaid, are to make war with the Lamb, that is, they make war with the Saints, and ſhed their blood.</p>
               <p>For theſe ten Kings do execute the will of the beaſt, in making war with the Saints, for in making war with the Saints, they may be ſaid to make war with the Lamb.</p>
               <p>And as the faith and patience of the Saints, did bear their cruel torments, to the terrifying of the ſouls of their perſecutors, even whileſt in this life.</p>
               <p>So that the ſufferings of the Saints with patience and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for they have no other weapons of war, but the weapon of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:62818:110"/>That is to ſay, <hi>a Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, the Sword of the Spirit,</hi> theſe are the Lambs weapons of war, and he doth furniſh his Saints with them, ſo that they ſhall be able to overcome all their enemies.</p>
               <p>Who fighteth with Spear, and Shield, or with Sword of ſteel, or Gun, theſe are the devils weapons of war, and he fighteth with the Saints, with theſe and ſuch like weapons, and ſo kills the body, and hath no more to do.</p>
               <p>That is, he puts to death this natural life, which is called, but a killing the body, and hath no more to do.</p>
               <p>But the weapons of war the Saints do uſe, they being ſpiritual, they kill the perſecutors ſoul, and yet ſhed no blood.</p>
               <p>For as carnal weapons doth kill the natural life of man, and ſhed his blood;</p>
               <p>So likewiſe thoſe ſpiritual weapons afore-mentioned, doth kill that ſpiritual life in the perſecutors, with an eternal or ſecond death, and yet ſhed no blood: and in this manner ſhall the Lamb overcome theſe ten Kings, which ten Kings doth include all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting ſpirits whatſoever.</p>
               <p>For the Lamb being King of kings, and Lord of Lords, he hath choſen his Saints, and they are faithful to fight under his banner, for he hath called them for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And the Lamb being their King and Captain, the Saints ſhall certainly overcome their perſecutors, and in this ſenſe the Lamb ſhall overcome them.</p>

               <p>Verſe the ſixteenth, <hi>And the ten borne thou ſaweſt upon the beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the where, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ten horns are thoſe ten Kings aforeſaid, they received

power before from the beaſt to perſecute the Saints, and to make war with the Lamb.</p>
               <p>And now they receive power from God to hate the whore, and to fight againſt her ſpiritual power, as you may ſee in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe, <hi>For God hath put it into their hearts, to fulfil his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I would have the Reader to minde, that theſe ten horns, or ten kings, doth imploy all wicked kings who are ſubordinate, or under the beaſt.</p>
               <p>For all wicked beaſts are included in this one beaſt, and all idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous ſpiritual power is included in this one whore, or City <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that God will put it into the hearts of wicked kings, to put down the ſpiritual power of idolatry.</p>
               <p>So that the Fifth-Monarchy-men are mightily miſtaken thinking in themſelves that thoſe Kings, or great perſons that ſhall pull down the Popes ſpiritual power, or any other ſpiritual power, that hath neer affinity with the Popiſh worſhip, I ſay they are much miſtaken.</p>
               <p>For God will put it into the hearts of wicked reprobate men, to do his will; they ſhall hate the whore, and make her deſolate and naked.</p>
               <p>That it, they ſhall ſmite her fleſh with a ſword of ſteel, and burn her with fire, that is, they ſhall utterly deſtroy her.</p>
               <p>For burning with fire ſignifies utter deſtruction, and eating her fleſh, it ſignifies the being well pleaſed in their mindes, ſo that their mindes doth feed upon the deſtruction of her; and in this ſenſe they may be ſaid to eat her fleſh.</p>
               <p>Onely this I do confeſs, that the Pope is that whore that muſt be made deſolate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the ſame ſpirit of fornication concerning ſpiritual matters, or worſhipping of idols, is in the Pope and others, as there was in other whores, who profeſs the ſame ſpiritual power as the Pope doth.</p>
               <p>For one ſpirit of idolatry hath run thorow the line of them all in all ages, and the Pope ſucceeding after the Ten Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he is called by the Spirit, a whore, and the laſt whore.</p>
               <p>And doth not ſhe by her ſpiritual power ſit upon many waters? which waters doth ſignifie multitudes of people, nations, and tongues, doth not ſhe by her ſpiritual power and temporal both, ſit almoſt upon all <hi>Europe?</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>So that when this whore is made deſolate, the world will be at an end.</p>
               <p>Onely this I would have the Fifth-Monarchy-men to minde, that they muſt be wicked reprobate men that doth make her deſolate, for all that fighteth with carnal weapons, that is a ſword and Gun, they are wicked.</p>
               <p>Though God doth put it into their hearts to do his will, for one wicked man ſhall deſtroy another with carnal weapons.</p>
               <p>For theſe ten horns which ſignifies all wicked Kings when they have made the whore deſolate, they ſhall give their kingdoms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beaſt, until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>That is, theſe conquerors over the whore, ſhall give their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms unto the Beaſt, who gave them Commiſſion and power at the firſt, to perſecute and kill the Saints.</p>
               <p>So that they take no notice that God did put it into their hearts to do his will upon the whore, but they attribute all the power and glory of it to the beaſt, looking more upon his Commiſſion and Authority that he gave them</p>
               <p>To deſtroy the Saints, and by the ſame Authority they think, they do make the whore deſolate, not minding Gods putting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is they give their kingdom unto the beaſt, until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>That is, they ſhall give their kingdoms unto the beaſt, until the end of the world.</p>
               <p>When God ſhall make a final end, that is, an eternal deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the beaſt, and of the whore, and of theſe ten horns, that gave their kingdoms unto the beaſt, then will the words of God be fulfilled.</p>

               <p>She may well be called <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, becauſe this <hi>Babylon</hi> is a ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of a longer ſtanding then the other <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> hath had a being ever ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were taken out of this world, ever ſince falſe worſhip hath been ſet up by man, and learned men hath had power given them from the civil Magiſtrate, to ſet up forms of worſhip.</p>
               <p>So that it is become the greateſt City in the world, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the end of time before it be utterly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Neither was there found in the deſtruction of the temporal <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> any blood of Prophets, Apoſtles, or Martyrs of Jeſus, as there will in this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For though the temporal <hi>Babylon</hi> was cruel, it was upon a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral account.</p>
               <p>Neither was their cruelty to laſt but a matter of threeſcore and ten years; but the cruelties of this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> it hath been upon a ſpiritual account.</p>
               <p>And theſe cruelties hath been acted by her this many thouſand years, ſo that all the blood that hath been ſhed upon a ſpiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, from the creation to the end of time, may be brought upon this great City ſpiritual <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe ſhe is become an habitation of devils, &amp; a hold of every foul ſpirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</p>
               <p>It may well be ſaid ſhe is a habitation of devils, for none but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils will execute her commands, and ſuch people that are of the worſt ſort of devils, even unclean ſpirits, or like hateful birds.</p>
               <p>So that her power and authority, it is as a cage to ſhelter theſe devils, and unclean ſpirits, and hateful birds.</p>
               <p>For this is to be minded by the Reader, that theſe devils are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62818:113"/>
men, the unclean ſpirits or men, and the hateful birds are men, and thoſe wicked men who are imployed in the whores ſervice, to puniſh all thoſe that will worſhip not her idols, or falſe worſhip.</p>
               <p>So that ſhe is become a cage for all wicked ſpirited people to ſhroud themſelves under.</p>
               <p>As may be ſeen in the third verſe, <hi>For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the Kings of the earth have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication with her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, by her ſpiritual power ſhe hath ſent forth theſe devils, unclean ſpirits, and hateful birds, with commiſſion from her to all nations to drink the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
               <p>That is, if the nations would not commit fornication with idols willingly.</p>
               <p>That is, worſhip according to her command; for her idolatrous worſhip, the pleaſure ſhe receives in it, is called the wine of her fornication.</p>
               <p>But if people will not obey to worſhip, as is required by theſe unclean ſpirits, and hateful birds,</p>
               <p>Then they muſt drink of the wrath of her fornication, perhaps excommunication, or death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>For though ſhe hath a golden cup in her hand full of wine, yet if people will not drink with her freely and willingly, ſhe will put poyſon, that is, her wrath into the wine, and make them drink whether they will or no.</p>
               <p>So that they muſt either drink her wine without wrath, or the wine of her fornication, and her wrath together.</p>
               <p>Oh how many millions of people have drunk her wine alone, and many thouſands have drunk her wine and wrath together?</p>
               <p>And that which is more then this, the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her.</p>
               <p>That is, the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, in that they have worſhipped falſe gods, by the inſtigation of the whore, ſhe making them believe that this is the way to ſave their ſouls.</p>
               <p>So that ſhe hath deceived the Kings of the earth, and all nations, either by their committing ſpiritual fornication with her, or elſe by drinking the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
               <p>So that the Kings of the earth are in a worſe condition then the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62818:113"/>
other, becauſe they committed fornication with her, that is, they were acceſſary to the ſetting up of all falſe worſhip, and in the councel with her.</p>
               <p>So that the nations that did drink the wine of the wrath of her fornication, they did but obey her command, and ſo committed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with idols from a Law, and a command.</p>
               <p>But it was otherways with the Kings of the earth; but however, ſhe, and all thoſe that have committed fornication with her, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by conſulting with her, or by obeying her commands, when ſhe is deſtroyed with an eternal deſtruction, ſo will all theſe that have committed fornication with her, be where ſhe is to eternity.</p>

               <p>THerefore in the fourth verſe, <hi>John heard another voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, Come out of her my people, that you be not partakers of her ſins, and that you receive not of her Plagues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ſhould Gods people come out of her?</p>
               <p>The Spirit doth not mean, that they ſhould come out of the world, for ſhe doth deceive all nations, and her power is every where, where Gods people doth dwell.</p>
               <p>So that there is no going out from her power, except they go among the heathen.</p>
               <p>But the meaning of the Spirit is this, that Gods people ſhould come from their idolatrous worſhip and practiſe.</p>
               <p>So that you may not commit fornication with idols, that you may not be partakers with them of their ſins, and ſo you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none of her plagues.</p>
               <p>For in the fifth verſe, <hi>Her ſins have reached up to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now ſhe muſt be rewarded as ſhe rewarded the Saints, as in the ſixth verſe, <hi>Reward her even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double, according to her works, in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, as ſhe hath drunk the blood of Prophets, the blood of Apoſtles, the blood of Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus, now ſhe muſt have her own blood to drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:62818:114"/>And not onely ſo, but her cup muſt be filled up double, that is, ſhe ſhall drink the torments of her own ſoul eternally.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as one torment is ſuffered, the cup of her ſoul ſhall be filled up again with another torment.</p>
               <p>So that her cup ſhall be always full of torment for her to drink eternally.</p>
               <p>And thus will her cup be filled double and double again.</p>
               <p>For though God hath ſuffered his ſervants the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Saints, to have their blood poured out and drunk by this whore and the beaſt,</p>
               <p>The time will come that he will avenge their blood upon theſe two, and all their adherents, and give them their own blood double to drink.</p>
               <p>So that their cup ſhall be ſo full of the wine of Gods wrath, that they ſhall be drinking of it to eternity.</p>
               <p>As for the ſeventh verſe, there is little matter of concernment, ſo I ſhall paſs it by, and ſpeak a little of the eighth verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>Therefore ſhall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire, for ſtrong is the Lord God, who judgeth her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This eighth verſe doth determine a total and final deſtruction of the ſpiritual whore, or City <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that her plagues ſhall come in one day death and mourning.</p>
               <p>That is the firſt death, which is a natural death, it ſhall enter into a ſecond death, and cauſe much mourning, becauſe it is a living death, and a dying life.</p>
               <p>Elſe there would be no mourning in death: and as for the famine ſhe ſhall ſuffer, the meaning is this.</p>
               <p>That there ſhall be ſuch a famine, or want of peace in her ſoul in the ſecond death, that no motion, or thought of peace, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance ſhall ariſe in her ſoul to give any hope, ſo that there will be a famine of peace indeed, for ſhe will be utterly burnt with fire.</p>
               <p>It will be a fire indeed, for the fire of Gods wrath will burn eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and never be quenched, beſides the deſtruction of the glory of this world.</p>
               <p>So that the Reader may ſee, what will be the end of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the beaſt and all falſe worſhippers.</p>
               <p>Which thing hath been propheſied of ever ſince <hi>Moſes,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Which deſtruction and utter downfal, is concluded by <hi>Johns Revelation</hi> in the eighteenth chapter and the eighth verſe, ſo that I ſhall patiently wait the time when God will make it viſibly appear, yet by faith I do know it will certainly be ſo, even as all Prophets, and Apoſtles have done before me.</p>

               <p>FRom the eighth verſe to the twentieth verſe, it is onely a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the aſtoniſhment in the mindes of men, who were Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and had trading at Sea, who were made rich by trading with idolatrous people.</p>
               <p>For the Kings of the earth, who have committed fornication with her, and lived deliciouſly with her, they ſhall bewail and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her when they ſee the ſmoak of her burning.</p>
               <p>They may well lament for her, for they have committed forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with her, ſo that they ſhall ſuffer with her.</p>
               <p>For there will be but little time for them to ſee the ſmoak of her burning, before they are in it themſelves.</p>
               <p>But the Spirit doth ſpeak what the heart of man would ſpeak, in caſe there were time given men to ſee ſuch a deſtruction, and he not in it himſelf.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe it is ſaid, <hi>They ſtanding afar off, for fear of her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſtanding afar off, is onely to ſet forth what the minde of man doth uſe to do in the caſe of a temporal deſtruction, or if a temporal City were to be burnt up.</p>
               <p>Men that are afraid will ſtand afar off for fear, there is the ſame thoughts in man, as to the end of the world, men would ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, when that comes, if they could.</p>
               <p>So that the Kings who committed fornication with her, and the Merchants that were made rich by her, they did ſtand afar off in their mindes, for fear of her torment.</p>
               <p>But they were quickly in it as well as ſhe, and all that lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that was made rich by her, in reſpect of that riches and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral coſtlineſs that they had by her, it was all in the minde of man, and would have done ſo indeed had they had time.</p>
               <p>For if this great City was deſtroyed in one hour, there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time to ſtand afar off to ſee her torment.</p>
               <p>But the Spirit ſpeaks forth what is in the nature and minde of man, and what he doth uſe to do in temporal things, and would do at that day if they could.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſhall paſs by all their lamentation, <hi>Alas, alas, this great City!</hi> and come to the twentieth verſe.</p>

               <p>VErſe the twentieth, <hi>Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets: for God hath avenged you on her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Reader may ſee, that the holy Apoſtles and Prophets are encouraged to rejoyce at the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> before ſhe is deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>For ſhe is not deſtroyed yet, neither are the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles as yet capable to rejoyce over her deſtruction, for moſt of them are aſleep in the duſt of the earth.</p>
               <p>But it is a uſual thing for the Spirit to ſpeak of things at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as at preſent being, becauſe God that is truth, or the God of truth, cannot lie; but will give unto his ſervants the Prophets and Apoſtles, the things he promiſed them.</p>
               <p>And they by faith believed him, and did ſuffer perſecution and the loſs of their lives by this City <hi>Babylon,</hi> giving themſelves up to their wicked wills, depending upon God to avenge their blood on her.</p>
               <p>So that they by faith did obtain the aſſurance in themſelves that God would avenge their blood on her.</p>
               <p>Again, the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John</hi> may bid them rejoyce, becauſe it is the nature of Faith to rejoyce: and not onely ſo, but the holy Apoſtles and Prophets ſhall, and will certainly rejoyce that God hath avenged them on her.</p>
               <p>This is in like manner as the Kings and Merchants aforeſaid, did ſtand afar off, and lament the downfal and deſtruction of this great City <hi>Babylon.</hi>

               <p>VErſe the 21. <hi>And a mighty Angel took up a ſtone like a great mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and caſt it into the ſea, ſaying, Thus with violence ſhall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Reader may ſee, that the lamentation of the Kings and the Merchants, and the rejoycing of the Heaven, and the holy Apoſtles and Prophets, are ſet before the downfal of this City <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo that which muſt be firſt is laſt, and that which muſt be laſt, firſt.</p>
               <p>This is that which puzzles all the wiſe men in reaſon, but the Spirit of Faith can trace the ſteps of God, and finde him out where ever he goeth.</p>
               <p>For the Scriptures, the Law, and the Prophets, and the Goſpel have been the pathes for Gods Spirit to walk in: but there hath been many turnings and windings in theſe two beaten pathes.</p>
               <p>I may ſay beaten by the ſeed of Reaſon: the ſeed of Reaſon, Non commiſſionated men, have travelled thorow theſe two pathes theſe many hundred years, but never could finde out thoſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row pathes where Gods Spirit uſe to go.</p>
               <p>Neither could they finde him; for if they could have found
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62818:116"/>
him, they would have known him, and many other heavenly My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries which is of abſolute neceſſity for man to know, but it is hid from their eyes, and revealed to mean and inferior men in the ſight of the world.</p>
               <p>So that all Commiſſionated Prophets, and Apoſtles, and true Witneſſes of the Spirit, can trace the narrow pathes where God goeth; nay, though God ſeem to hide himſelf, yet the Spirit of Revelation will finde him out.</p>
               <p>Did not the Prophets finde out the meaning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo came to know the God of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did not the Apoſtles finde out the Spirit of God in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets writings?</p>
               <p>Hath not God given us the Witneſſes of the Spirit to finde out the meaning of the Prophets, and of the Apoſtles?</p>
               <p>And ſo we have found the true God in all thoſe narrow pathes he hath walked in by his Spirit, in the Law, and in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Nay, and in this Book of the <hi>Revelation of John,</hi> God hath as it were hid himſelf more obſcure than in moſt places of the Bible, yet the revelation of Faith hath found him out, as will be ſeen by the eye of Faith in this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>But the Reader may know, that the latter part of this Chapter, from the twentieth verſe to the end, is onely the Spirits rehearſing of the deſtruction of this ſpiritual <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of the ranſacking of that great City by the Angels, who poured out the vials of Gods wrath upon her, even as an Army doth ranſack a City when they are overcome by their enemies.</p>
               <p>As in the 22, 23, 24 verſes, <hi>And the voice of Harpers, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Pipers and Trumpetters ſhall be heard no more at all in her.</hi>

               <p>That is, all lights whatſoever ſhall be taken from her, and that joy of marrying and giving in marriage, ſhall be taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:62818:116"/>Theſe things afore-mentioned, doth include all the glory and comfort that can be had, or that men have had in this world.</p>
               <p>The wrath of God hath ranſacked this City of all, and in the ranſacking of this City, there God doth finde the blood of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth, as you may ſee in the laſt verſe of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>So that God will ranſack this City <hi>Babylon,</hi> even as the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> did <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.10.

               <p>That deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was much like unto this, onely that was but for a time, and that a ſhort time too, but this is for eternity. So much for the interpretation of the chief things in the eighteenth Chapter.</p>

               <p>IN the eighteenth Chapter, <hi>Johns</hi> revelation and viſion did treat onely upon the utter downfal and deſtruction of the ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> and this nineteenth Chapter doth ſet forth the joy, and glory, and triumph the Saints and Angels have in the deſtruction of this great City.</p>
               <p>For now doth begin their eternal glory, and not before; neither is the one, nor the other not as yet.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the viſion the downfal of the Whore, ſo in his viſion he ſaw the rejoycing of the Saints and Angels in heaven after her deſtruction, which things will be as certain, as if at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; therefore it is that <hi>John</hi> doth ſay he ſaw theſe things as if they were performed and done already.</p>
               <p>For it is a uſual courſe of the Spirit to ſpeak of things to come, as if they were in preſent being, becauſe the Seed of Faith can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſtay Gods time for the accompliſhment of his promiſe.</p>
               <p>And are contented onely with the aſſurance of faith in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they ſhall rejoyce in heaven, that God hath avenged their blood upon this wicked city <hi>Babylon,</hi> who killed the Prophets, Apoſtles, Saints, and Martyrs of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Chapter nineteen, <hi>And after theſe things I heard a great voice of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62818:117"/>
much people in heaven, ſaying, Allelujah, ſalvation, and glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and power, unto the Lord our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is this, after <hi>John</hi> had ſeen the utter overthrow of this great idolatrous City <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately after he heard a great voice of much people in heaven, that is, he heard the voice of the twenty four Elders, the four Beaſts, the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and the multitudes of Saints which cannot be numbered, and the holy Angels, ſaying, or giving praiſe unto God in ſuch like words as theſe, Allelujah, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſounding forth their praiſe unto God together, muſt needs be a great voice indeed: onely this is to be minded, that none but the revelation of the Spirit could hear it in heaven, and yet be here upon earth.</p>
               <p>So that this great voice <hi>John</hi> heard in heaven, it was by thoſe aforeſaid, in praiſe unto God that he had avenged the blood of his ſervants at her hand, as you may ſee in the ſecond and third verſe.</p>
               <p>Again they ſaid, <hi>Allelujah, and her ſmoak roſe up for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all this joy and glory <hi>John</hi> heard in heaven, it was even for this one thing, that God had judged thus, to give that whore who corrupted the earth with her ſpiritual fornication, a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual torment, that the ſmoak of it might aſcend for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>And in verſe the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>The four and twenty elders, and the four beaſts fell down and worſhipped God, that ſate on the throne ſaying, Amen, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah:</hi> ſo that you may ſee that all are concern'd in this matter, to give praiſe unto God for this judgement upon her.</p>
               <p>Theſe four beaſts, the Reader may remember I have ſhewed what they are in this Treatiſe, but for the four and twenty Elders, I have ſaid little of them here, but I have ſpoken more largely of them <hi>in the Interpretation of the eleventh of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the fifth verſe, <hi>A voice came out of the Throne, ſaying, Praiſe our God all ye his ſervants, and ye that ſerve him both ſmall and great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſervants ſignifies his Prophets, and Meſſengers whom God did ſend.</p>
               <p>Small and great doth ſignifie all true believers, or Saints, let them be ever ſo great in faith and knowledge, or ever ſo ſmall, or weak in faith and knowledge.</p>
               <p>Yet ſo it be true faith though but ſmall, they are all required by
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62818:117"/>
that voice from the Throne to praiſe God: and for what muſt they praiſe God for? even for his judgement upon the whore.</p>
               <p>And not onely ſo, but that God will raign now himſelf over you in eternal joy and glory, and raign over the wicked perſecutors in eternal pain and ſhame, as you may ſee in the ſixth verſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANd I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a mighty thundering, ſaying, Allelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and as the voice of many thunderings, they are the ſame as I ſaid before, to wit, the four and twenty Elders, the four Beaſts, the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and the multitude of Saints more then can be numbered, and the holy Angels.</p>
               <p>Theſe in their praiſes unto God, was the voice of many waters, and the voice of thunderings.</p>
               <p>I ſay, theſe are they that doth ſing Allelujah to the Lord God omnipotent, who reigneth for ever and ever, in joy and glory with his Saints, and for ever and ever over the reprobates in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>For theſe voices ſay in the ſeventh verſe, <hi>Let us be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and give honor to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is to God, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her ſelf ready.</p>
               <p>This Marriage is an eternal Marriage with God, and the elect ſeed, for all the elect ſeed are Saints from the beginning of the world to the end of it, are called by the Spirit, but one virgin.</p>
               <p>And this Lamb the virgins Husband, is no other but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>So that at the end of time, all the Elect Seed ſhall be married unto God their King, &amp; Redeemer, not onely in true righteouſneſs and holineſs, as they were in the ſtate of grace here in this world;</p>
               <p>But they ſhall be marryed unto the Lamb, which is the onely wiſe God bleſſed for evermore, to that eternal felicity, joy, and glory with him.</p>
               <p>So that his wife ſhall have a propriety in thoſe eternal joys, even as a vertuous woman hath here in her husbands eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:62818:118"/>For in the eighth verſe, <hi>And to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the fine linen is the righteouſneſs of Saints, that is, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith.</p>
               <p>For faith purifies the the heart, and Saints being clothed with this righteouſneſs of Faith, they become virgins.</p>
               <p>They are called virgins, in that they are not defiled in their ſouls with idols and falſe worſhip, which is called by the Spirit, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or whoredom.</p>
               <p>So that this Bride the Lambs wife, being clothed with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith, it is called by the Spirit, fine linen clean and white, and this is the righteouſneſs of Saints, who is the Bride to God her Husband;</p>
               <p>Who putteth upon this white cloathing a Garment of eternal glory, which will ſhine more brighter than the Sun.</p>
               <p>More might be ſaid in this thing, but I ſuppoſe there is enough ſaid to ſatisfie the Seed of Faith.</p>
               <p>And as for the nineth and tenth verſes I ſhall paſs them by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſpoken of them, and given the meaning of them in <hi>the Interpretation of the eleventh of the Revelation.</hi>

               <p>VErſe the eleventh, <hi>And I ſaw heaven opened, and he hold a white horſe, and he that ſate upon him was called, Faithful, and true, and in righteouſneſs he doth judge, and make war.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This white horſe, is the ſame white horſe as I ſpake of before in the ſixth chapter of <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> and he that ſate upon this white horſe, is the ſame that ſate upon that white horſe, to wit, the righteouſneſs of Saints.</p>
               <p>And he that ſate upon this white horſe, was no other but Chriſt Jeſus, the onely wiſe God, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>For this is to be minded by the Reader, that though Chriſt hath a righteouſneſs of his own, which may be a white horſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſit upon, he being called Faithful, and true, and in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs he doth judge,</p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſs the righteouſneſs of Saints is included all into one righetouſneſs, ſo make up but one white horſe for the onely wiſe God to ſit upon, and to make war.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:62818:118"/>That is, he made war with death, hell, and the devil, as I ſaid before, and overcame them, and ſo had many Crowns upon his head, as you may ſee in the 12 verſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe many Crowns upon his head, they ſignifie but two Crowns; all other Crowns of glory which he hath, they are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in theſe two.</p>
               <p>That is, he hath a Crown of glory upon his head, as he is the Creator of all things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat is, all creatures according to the inſtinct of nature, do ſhew forth honor and glory unto a Divine Being, who hath created all things for his own glory.</p>
               <p>So that there is an exceeding great Crown of glory upon the head of Chriſt Jeſus, as he is the Creator, and the other Crown of glory upon his head, it is as he is the Redeemer.</p>
               <p>For Redemption in all thoſe that are concerned in it, is of more worth, and of higher eſteem, than the work of Creation is.</p>
               <p>So that this work of Redemption it hath procured to himſelf a a Crown of glory of more weight, then the work of Creation.</p>
               <p>So that all Crowns of glory he hath upon his head, they are all included in theſe two, and the white horſe he doth fit upon it, is the righteouſneſs of Faith.</p>
               <p>For by this righteouſneſs of Faith he conquered death, hell, and devil, and by this Faith he hath made war with theſe ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and by the ſame power of Faith he will overcome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all temporal enemies with an eternal deſtruction, as <hi>John</hi> doth ſpeak of, as if it were already done, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Verſe the twelfth, <hi>His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many Crowns, and he had a Name written that no man know but he himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his eyes being as it were a flame of fire, that is, onely to ſignifie the exceeding glory, and brightneſs of his eyes.</p>
               <p>They are ſo piercing, that he can ſee thorow Angels and men, ſo that no mortal man can look upon him, no more then the eyes of a man are able to look upon the Sun in its brightneſs: and as for the many Crowns upon his head, I have ſpoken of that in the verſe before.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid, <hi>And he had a Name written that no man knew but he himſelf.</hi> The meaning is this, there was no man knew his Name that was written upon him but he himſelf, until he did reveal it to ſome man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:62818:119"/>For who knew him by the Name of <hi>Jehovah, God Almighty,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he revealed it to <hi>Moſes?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As it is ſaid in the Goſpel of <hi>John, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that his name muſt needs be the Word of God, and how ſhould any man know this but he himſelf, until he did reveal it unto ſome man: ſo that when the Name of God was known to no man but to he himſe f,</p>
               <p>The thing was then a ſecret thing, but now it is revealed unto man, it doth belong unto us, and to our children.</p>
               <p>For ſecret things belong unto God, and revealed things to us, and our children.</p>
               <p>So that when God hath revealed any ſecret, or heavenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery unto man, it may not then be called no more ſecret, but man may know it in a meaſure even as God doth himſelf.</p>
               <p>So that the Name of God is known by his ſervants, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, and Witneſſes of the Spirit, and by his Saints, to their exceeding great joy and glory, ſo that his name is known to others now beſides himſelf.</p>

               <p>VErſe the thirteenth, <hi>And he was clothed with a veſture dipt in blood, and his Name is called, The word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader may remember, that when I came to the thirteenth verſe of the firſt Chapter of <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> I found ſuch a like ſaying as this, that is, <hi>John ſaw in the midſt of the ſeven golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks one like unto the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which garment I ſaid I would open hereafter; ſo that now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to it again, I ſhall open what is meant by this garment down to the foot, and by his veſture dipt in blood.</p>
               <p>This Son of Man <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the middeſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks, it was no other but Jeſus Chriſt, and this Jeſus Chriſt is the onely wiſe God, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And it is he that <hi>John</hi> ſaw clothed with a garment down to the foot, and it is he that is clothed with a veſture dipt in blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:62818:119"/>Now the word <hi>Veſture,</hi> and the word <hi>Garment,</hi> ſignifie; both one thing: onely this is to be minded by the Reader, what the Spirit doth mean by this garment down to his foot, and his veſture dipt in blood.</p>
               <p>The meaning of the Spirit is this: The eternal Spirit it became fleſh, ſo that the fleſh of Chriſt was a garment or a veſture that did clothe the God-head Spirit with.</p>
               <p>So that he being clothed with fleſh from the head to the foot, this fleſh is called by the Spirit <hi>a garment down to the foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this garment of fleſh, is that veſture dipt in blood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaing of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63.1. <hi>Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Wherefore art thou red in thy apparrel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-fat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is, that God would become fleſh, and ſo clothe himſelf with a garment of fleſh, ſo that this garment might be made red with blood.</p>
               <p>That is, the whole body of fleſh which is called the garment of the God-head-life, might be made red, even as one that treadeth the wine-fat;</p>
               <p>For if a man ſhould tread the wine fat of the grapes with no other apparel on but his fleſh onely it would make him look red as if he had been treading in a pool of blood.</p>
               <p>Even ſo doth the Prophets words ſignifie when he ſaith, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the wine-fat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if the Prophet ſhould ſay, Wherefore doth thy fleſh, which is thy apparel, or thy garment, look red? for thou haſt been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the wine-preſs of the wrath of Almighty God, like unto him that treadeth the wine fat of the grape.</p>
               <p>So that thy fleſh, which is thy garment down to the foot, muſt needs look red with blood; for the garment of his fleſh is that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture dipt in blood.</p>
               <p>This the Prophets did ſee by the eye of Faith, and ſo they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fleſh of Chriſt <hi>a Garment,</hi> red like the wine of the ripe grape, in regard he had not yet ſuffered death in the fleſh, but was to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>But the revelation of <hi>John</hi> ſaw that he had ſuffered death in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62818:120"/>
that fleſh, and therefore ſaith, <hi>And he was clothed with a veſture dipt in blood;</hi> meaning his fleſh was dipt in blood, in that he had trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the wine-preſs of the wrath of Almighty God; that is, he trod the wine-preſs of his own wrath againſt ſin.</p>
               <p>For he is the Almighty God himſelf, though he clothed himſelf with a garment of fleſh that he might be capable to die, and that aſon, the devil, might be the more capable to put him to death.</p>
               <p>r That the garment, or veſture of fleſh he had on him, might be dipt in blood for the redemption of the Seed of <hi>Adam</hi> to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, and that his blood might keep down the reprobate ſeed to endleſs miſery.</p>
               <p>So that the Reader may ſee what the Spirit doth mean by Chriſt being clothed with a garment down to the foot, and his veſture dipt in blood.</p>
               <p>For I think none are ſo ignorant, as to think that it was any woollen, or linnen, or ſilk garment that was dipt in blood, that would have been little benefit to any man.</p>
               <p>But the ignorance of people is ſo great, that they will think and believe any thing though never ſo contrary to reaſon, and yet ſeem to be wiſe men in reaſon; but the greater is their darkneſs in ſpiritual and heavenly things.</p>
               <p>Yet the Seed of Faith may ſee what this veſture dipt in blood is, and who it was that was clothed with this garment down to the foot: It was no other but God himſelf, as is ſaid in the ſame verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his Name is called, The word of God;</hi> for there is none can truly be called the Word of God, but God: <hi>for the Word was with God, and the Word was God,</hi> as I have ſhewed before.</p>

               <p>Theſe armies which were in heaven, they are the Saints; and the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Witneſſes of the Spirit, are the Captains over theſe armies, that is, all true Believers in every Commiſſion are in theſe three armies, and there is one Chief General in all the armies in heaven, and that is God himſelf.</p>

               <p>The Reader may remember that I ſhewed before what is meant by a white horſe, and how that God himſelf had a white horſe to ſit upon, to wit, his own righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
               <p>By which power of faith God created all things, and by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of faith he fulfilled the Law, and by the power of faith he laid down his life unto death, and by the power of faith did riſe again, ſo that this righteouſneſs of faith is that white horſe that Chriſt doth ſit upon.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the armies in heaven they follow him upon white hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes alſo: that is, all the Saints, as aforeſaid, being true Believers in Chriſts death, that his blood was the blood of God, ſo that this blood hath waſhed their ſouls in it, that their hearts are purified by faith in the blood of the Lamb, ſo that they have the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith in them; and this righteouſneſs of faith is called by the Spirit, <hi>A white horſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all the armies in heaven, that is all true Believers, they have white horſes to ſit upon to follow their God, their King, and their Redeemer.</p>
               <p>And as for their being clothed in fine linnen, white and clean, that ſignifies their ſouls being purified by faith, the guilt of all ſin is cleanſed from them; ſo that though their ſouls were as red as ſcarlet with the guilt of ſin, yet now being purified by faith they are made as white as ſnow: So that their ſouls are clothed now with peace, joy, and glory which is as <hi>fine linnen, white and clean, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>This ſharp ſword that goeth out of his mouth, it is out of the mouth of Chriſt; that is, when he ſhall command his Angels to pour out their vials of wrath, or plagues, upon the enemies of truth.</p>
               <p>It may be called a ſharp ſword that goeth out of his mouth, ſo that by the word of his mouth he ſhall cauſe his Angels to ſmite the nations: and when they have ſmitten them dead, he by a word of his mouth will raiſe them again, and rule them with a rod of iron, in that he will make them undergo a ſecond death.</p>
               <p>So that the two-edged ſword that goeth out of his mouth, ſhall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62818:121"/>
cut both ways, that is to ſay, it ſhall cut down this natural life, and cut down that ſpiritual life alſo, ſo that after death they ſhall have a living death, and a dying life; ſo that he will rule them with a rod of iron in utter darkneſs, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth for evermore.</p>
               <p>For as much as he hath trod the wine-preſs of the fierceneſs and wrath of Almighty God, he hath purchaſed to himſelf a greater power than he had before, even a power, that after he hath kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this natural life, to kill both body and ſoul of his enemies in hell fire, that is, with a ſecond and eternal death, and ſo he will rule them with a rod of iron indeed.</p>
               <p>I would not have the Reader to ſtumble, becauſe it is ſaid in Scripture in divers places, and in this verſe alſo, <hi>that he treadeth the wine-preſs of the wrath of Almighty God,</hi> as if there were a Father above Chriſt, as men have vainly imagined, and have not ſtuck to ſay that Chriſt-trod the wine-preſs of his Fathers wrath.</p>
               <p>But I would have the Reader to know, that there is no ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the Bible, as that he trode the wine-preſs of his Fathers wrath; but <hi>he treadeth the wine-preſs of the wrath of Almighty God,</hi> for he is the Almighty God himſelf, though in a two-fold condition, as I have ſhewed before in this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Which methinks might ſatisfie the minde of any ſober mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man; but if it doth not ſatisfie the reaſon of man, I cannot help it, the thing is truth in it ſelf, and it was a truth to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, and to <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, and it is a truth to me, and will be a truth to all true Believers to the worlds end.</p>

               <p>VErſe the ſixteenth, <hi>And he hath on his Veſture, and on his Thigh, a Name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This veſture is the body of his fleſh, as I ſaid before; and on his thigh, ſignifies that part of his veſture that is moſt fitteſt to write his name upon, the thigh being the moſt fleſhy part of a man, and ſo moſt fitteſt to write upon.</p>
               <p>That is, it was the moſt fitteſt part of all the body to thruſt the ſpear into, ſo that there was written on his veſture, and on his thigh, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, he was pierced with the devils ſpear in the body, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62818:121"/>
in his thigh, and by the blood that came out of his own veſture, there was this name written upon his own body, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, that body was the body of God, and that blood was the blood of God: ſo that he being the King of Heaven, he muſt needs be <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords:</hi> for who is King of kings, but God himſelf onely?</p>
               <p>So that as he was the Creator of all things, he had this Name written on him as he was the Creator, <hi>Jehovah, God Almighty, I am that I am;</hi> this was the Name of God as he was the Creator, and this name was written on his Spiritual body, which was his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture for his God-head Spirit to live in; but now God is become fleſh, and hath cloathed the Godhead Life with a garment of fleſh as a veſture, and ſhed his moſt precious blood, he being in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Son, or a Servant, he made himſelf capable of the pains of death, and ſo died unto Sin; that is, to ſatisfie ſin, for nothing could ſatisfie ſin, but the blood of God.</p>
               <p>And by his dying unto it, he deſtroyed ſin, in that death could not keep him under it.</p>
               <p>For if death could have kept that body of Chriſt in the grave, ſo that it might not have riſen again, then ſin and death would have lived for ever and ever, and this world would have had no end.</p>
               <p>So that by this death of God, he hath conquered ſin, death, and hell for the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> that they ſhall have no power over them, not as to keep them under eternal torments.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, he hath by his death overcome ſin, death, and hell, ſo as to make them ſerve for the eternal torment of the ſeed of the ſerpent who have acted ſin.</p>
               <p>So that as he hath gone thorow the condition of a Redeemer, and overcome ſin, death, and hell, upon thoſe two conſiderations aforeſaid,</p>
               <p>By the body of his fleſh he hath purchaſed to himſelf, as he is the Redeemer, a name written on that body of fleſh, which is called his veſture, <hi>King of kings, and Lords of lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here is one thing more to be minded, that this death of Chriſt was that which treadeth the wine-preſs of the wrath of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>For God was wrath with ſin, and nothing could puniſh ſin, but
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62818:122"/>
an eternal death, ſo that God having no way to deſtroy ſin, and to be even with the ſerpent, that brought ſin and death into the world, not onely to himſelf, and his own ſeed, but alſo to <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
               <p>So that God being willing to avenge himſelf of the ſerpent, and his ſeed, and to reſtore <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Seed again, he took upon him the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not the nature of Angels, of whoſe nature the ſerpent was of.</p>
               <p>And ſo clothed the eternal ſpirit with a body of fleſh, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up the eternal ſpirit unto death, that he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, which is the devil, which devil is no other but the ſpirit of reaſon in man.</p>
               <p>So that as death was in the devils hands before Chriſts death, yet now by his death, he hath gained the power of death himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto his own hands.</p>
               <p>So that now he will deliver his own ſeed from it, and will inflict the ſame death eternal upon the devil and his ſeed, as he would have done upon God and his ſeed.</p>
               <p>So that the wrath of Almighty God it was againſt ſin and death, which the ſerpent brought into this world upon all the ſeed of <hi>Adam:</hi> and the body of God by the aſſiſtance of the eternal ſpirit, muſt tread the wine-preſs of it.</p>
               <p>That is, the eternal ſpirit was the life of the blood, that was in that bleſſed body, ſo that he poured out his ſoul unto death, and was offered up throw the eternal ſpirit: and this was the treading the wine-preſs of the wrath of Almighty God, he being the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God himſelf, and by this work of Redemption, he hath a Name written upon that body of fleſh he ſuffered death in, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs theſe things are deep myſteries, hard for me to explain in words, and more hard to be underſtood by thoſe who know not what revelation doth mean.</p>
               <p>For things of this nature cannot be explained with that eaſe, as other matters may, which is more eaſie to underſtand; but the Seed of Faith may ſee, what is meant by the wine-preſs of Gods wrath, and who it was that treadeth it in, that his ſoul was made an offering forſin, and ſo hath a Name by his ſufferings, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>IN this ſixteenth verſe, <hi>John</hi> hath concluded the marriage of the Lamb, with the joy, and glory the Saints ſhall have in heaven, over the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, over the deſtruction of all wicked perſecuting men from the beginning of the world to the latter end thereof, and by what means theſe things hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
               <p>Even by that ſharp Sword that goeth out of Chriſts mouth, in giving his Angels command to pour out the vials of his wrath upon the earth, and by his own garment dipt in blood, hath he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed glory, and eternal happineſs to the Saints; and ſhame, and endleſs miſery to the reprobate.</p>
               <p>So that in the latter part of this chapter, the Spirit doth call to rememberance, the great deſtruction of that great City <hi>Babylon,</hi> and doth incite the Saints in heaven to increaſe their joy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by feeding upon the deſtruction of that great whore, who cauſed all the nations of the earth to drink the wine of her forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as you may ſee in the ſeventeenth verſe.</p>

               <p>Theſe fowls that fly in the midſt of heaven, are the Saints; they are called by the Spirit, the fowls that fly in the midſt of heaven, and theſe fowls are invited to Supper with the great God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This verſe doth imply all, both great and ſmall, that fought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the banner of the beaſt, and the falſe prophet; which falſe

prophet ſignifies the ſpiritual Power of the whore, as aforeſaid, and the beaſt ſignifies the Civil Power, or Head-magiſtrate, who committed fornication with the woman, and ſo joyned together to fight againſt God and his Saints.</p>
               <p>And theſe Kings, Captains, and mighty men, and ſmall and great, they were all authorized by theſe two Powers aforeſaid, to fight againſt God, and his Saints, and ſo they did perſecute and kill many of them, yea, they killed Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>So that now as theſe men did eat the fleſh of the Saints, and drink their blood, in that they were pleaſed in their mindes that they had ſhed the blood of Saints, and the blood of Prophets and Apoſtles; for that is called by the Spirit, <hi>eating and drinking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe now the great God hath by the ſword that goeth out of his mouth, deſtroyed with a final and eternal deſtruction thoſe Kings, Captains, and great Men aforeſaid: Now the great God and all his Army of Saints, who are the fowls of heaven, ſhall ſup with the fleſh of theſe men, aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>That is, they ſhall eat their fleſh, not with their teeth; but their ſpirits ſhall feed upon their eternal damnation with joy &amp; delight, ſo that their ſouls ſhall be ſatisfied, or filled with their fleſh.</p>
               <p>For the fowls of heaven ſhall feed upon their eternal damnation in their mindes, even as men do upon the tendreſt fleſh that is with their teeth; and their ſpirits will be as well ſatisfied with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as mens hungry ſtomachs are with ſweet fleſh.</p>

               <p>But he that ſate upon the horſe was Chriſt, and his Army that followed him were the Saints, and his horſe was a white horſe, and all his Army ſate upon white horſes alſo, as I ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>But he that ſate upon the horſe was too hard for the Beaſt and the Kings of the earth, ſo that the Beaſt was taken, as in verſe 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe prophet, that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the Beaſt, and them that worſhipped his image. Theſe both were caſt alive into a lake of fire burning with brimſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Beaſt and falſe prophet ſignifie the Civil Power, and the Eccleſiaſtical, or Spiritual Power; for the beaſt ſignifies the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power, and the falſe prophet ſignifies the Spiritual Power.</p>
               <p>For theſe two always committed fornication together, and in all Ages they joyned together to perſecute the Prophets, Apoſtles, Saints, and Chriſt himſelf, and ſo they will do to the end of time.</p>

               <p>That is, he ſaw the whole temporal Power of this world, and the whole ſpiritual Power of this world, who joyned together in falſe worſhip, and in perſecuting the Saints, <hi>John</hi> ſaw them both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>&amp; they were both caſt alive into a lake of fire burning with brimſtone.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Verſe 21. <hi>And the remnant were ſlain with the ſword of him that ſat upon the horſe, which ſword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their fleſh.</hi>

               <p>The remnant that were ſlain, ſignifies all thoſe that were of the Beaſts and falſe prophets minde, yet did not gather themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Beaſts Army, but they were as it were a remnant left behinde as a Reſerve; as it is a cuſtom for Generals of Armies to leave a remnant behinde as a Reſerve: but if the Generals Army be beaten, and he taken, the remnant will quickly be deſtroyed by him that overcometh.</p>

               <p>Onely I ſhall give a word or two, to ſhew what is meant by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog:</hi> This <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is the Turk, Pagan, and all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then men, who never profeſſed the worſhip of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Goſpel: that is, the ſame ſpirit that was in the heathen in former time, who were called by the Spirit <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 39.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, behold, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, O Gog.</hi> And in verſe 6. <hi>God will ſend a fire on Magog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So chapter 38.2. <hi>Son of Man, ſet thy face againſt Gog, the land of Magog:</hi> and in the 3 verſe, <hi>and ſay, Thus ſaith the Lord, behold, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, O Gog, the chief Princes of</hi> Meſhech.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> it was no other but <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> he, I ſay, is called by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Gog, as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36 6, and all his princes who had great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who helped him to fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Spirit <hi>Magog,</hi> as you may ſee 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.1, 2. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> came up: that is, he came up to fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there came againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> bands of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> and bands of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and bands of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and bands of the children of <hi>Ammon;</hi> theſe all came againſt <hi>Judah</hi> to deſtroy it, and ſo they did, according to the word of the Lord. And theſe bands of men, aforeſaid, are called by the Spirit <hi>Magog;</hi> ſo that it may be clear to the Reader, that this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>John,</hi> it is meant all the Heathen power upon the face of the earth, in that the heathen hath three parts of the world in his hands. For this
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62818:125"/>
is to be minded by the Reader, that this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſpoken of by the Prophets, they were Heathen powers, and people who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did profeſs, nor confeſs the Scriptures of truth: And this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog John</hi> ſpeaketh of, are Heathen men alſo; for the ſame ſpirit that was in that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> it doth run in the line of that ſeed, even to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>So that the Heathen that ſhall be deſtroyed at the end of time, may be called <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> as the other <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed after the ſeventy years were expired, they were deſtroyed with a temporal deſtruction; but this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog John</hi> ſpeaketh of, they will be deſtroyed with an eternal deſtruction at the end of time.</p>
               <p>For this ſpirit of reaſon, the devil, or Satan, that was bound for a thouſand years, and when the thouſand years was expired, he was let looſe, which things I have opened in <hi>The Interpretation of the eleventh of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpirit of reaſon, the devil, as aforeſaid, it being looſed out of priſon, which priſon I have ſhewed what it is in that book afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſo that this Satan being looſed, he goeth forth to deceive the nations, which are in the four quarters of the earth, as in the eighth verſe of this chapter, <hi>Gog and Magog to gather them together to battel,</hi> the number of whom is as the ſand of the Sea.</p>
               <p>So that the Reader may ſee, that Satan ſhall go out to deceive the nations that are in the four quarters of the earth, which four quarters doth ſignifie all the world; for the world is divided but into four parts, and all theſe four parts of the earth, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by this ſpirit of Satan, which ſpirit of Satan I have ſhewed what it is in my other writings: but this is to be minded, that the Saints; the Seed of Faith, are excepted by the Spirit, for though they live in the four parts of the earth, yet they are not deceived by the ſpirit of Satan, not as to their eternal perdition as the other is, ſo that this is to be underſtood, that this Satan, the devil, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the nations in all the four quarters of the earth, to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perdition.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is to be minded, that there is a principle of perſecution for religion &amp; worſhip, even in <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> that is to ſay, in all the heathen, as there is in thoſe that profeſs and confeſs the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>For if <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> doth but hear of any man, or people, that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62818:126"/>
doth worſhip any other God beſides his God, he will perſecute him to death, eſpecially if he be a native under his dominions, and ſo is it with all profeſſors of Religion, who know not the true God, nor his true worſhip.</p>
               <p>So that Satan, the devil, he hath gone forth unto all the four quarters of the earth, and hath deceived the nations therein with falſe worſhips, and imagining of falſe gods, this many hundred years have they been deceived: and not onely ſo, but there is a ſpirit of perſecution, that doth run thorow the nations in all the four quarters of the earth, even amongſt profeſſors of the Scriptures, as there doth in the heathen.</p>
               <p>So that all the four quarters of the earth they fight againſt God, and compaſs the Camp of the Saints about, and the beloved City. The Saints are called by the Spirit the beloved City, ſo that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved City muſt needs be compaſſed about, becauſe the Saints doth live in the four quarters of the earth, and the nations of the four quarters of the earth being deceived by Satan, they perſecute the Saints every where.</p>
               <p>So that they by their perſecution, they have, and do, and will to the end of the world, compaſs the Camp of the Saints about, who is the beloved City.</p>
               <p>I ſay theſe aforeſaid, will compaſs the Camp of the Saints with perſecution, until fire come down from God out of heaven, and devour them; this fire that cometh down from heaven, it is meant that eternal fire of Gods wrath upon his enemies, as you may ſee in the 10 verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the devil that deceived them, was caſt into the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, where the beaſt, and the falſe prophet are, and ſhall be tormented day and night, for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> with all the nations of the four quarters of the earth, who were deceived by the ſpirit of reaſon, the devil, to worſhip falſe gods, and to perſecute the Saints in all parts of the earth.</p>
               <p>They ſhall at the end of the world, as aforeſaid, they ſhall be caſt into the ſame lake of fire and brimſtone, as the beaſt, and the falſe prophet are, and ſhall be tormented for ever and ever, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
               <p>So that at the end of the world, that ſpirit of reaſon which men
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62818:126"/>
received from the loſt Angel, with all its wiſdom whereby it hath deceived all the nations of the earth, and hath always perſecuted and killed the Saints, the beloved City of God, from the beginning of the world, even from the righteous <hi>Abel</hi> to the end of the world:</p>
               <p>I ſay, this ſpirit of reaſon which is called by the Spirit, Satan, a devil: this Spirit who hath cauſed <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and all the nations of the earth to perſecute the Saints.</p>
               <p>This devil, with all the ſeed who hath fought under his banner, though in ſeveral forms and manner, he, and they, with the beaſt, and falſe prophet, with all their adherents, ſhal be caſt into a lake of fire and brimſtone, where they ſhall be tormented for ever and ever: and this fire and brimſtone is that wrath of God that cometh down from heaven, which is called by the Spirit, fire that came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this chapter is but a rehearſal of what was ſaid before in the 18 and 19 chapters, both of the deſtruction of myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of the glory of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Yet I thought it ſomething neceſſary to open the meaning of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> becauſe I have not met with thoſe words before, neither have ſpoken of them in that book, aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But as for the reſt of the matter in this 20 chapter, I have ſaid as much as need be ſaid of it, in one place or other in this Treatiſe, and in <hi>The interpretation of the eleventh of the Revelation,</hi> and to repeat one thing twice, over would be needleſs: and as for the chief heads contained in the 21, 22 chapters, I have opened them in the ſaid <hi>Interpretation of the eleventh of the Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that I ſhall interpret a little what is meant by thoſe words of <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> the 22 chapter 18, 19 verſes, and ſo conclude this Epiſtle.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="81" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. LXXXI.</head>
               <p>THeſe words of <hi>John</hi> hath been an occaſion of many perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ignorant men, and womens ſpirits, to perſecute and rail againſt the pureſt truth that ever was declared, and againſt the true Meſſengers whom God hath choſen and ſent.</p>
               <p>Whom he hath endued with the ſpirit of Revelation, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scriptures, more then all the men in the world beſides, in that when things have been declared, and Scriptures interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62818:127"/>
beyond the common ſenſe that learned men have declared and interpreted, they have ſaid with great anger and zeal, that we have either added to the word of God, or elſe we have diminiſhed from it.</p>
               <p>Therefore to ſatisfie the Reader, I ſhall open how a man may be ſaid to add unto the propheſie of this Book of <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> and how he may be ſaid to diminiſh, or take away the words of this propheſie of this Book.</p>
               <p>The words of <hi>John</hi> are theſe, verſe 18. <hi>For I teſtifie unto every man that heareth the words of the propheſie of this book, if any man ſhall adde unto theſe things, God ſhall adde unto him the plagues that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 19. <hi>And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this propheſie, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of Life, and out of the holy City, and from the things which are written in this book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have the Reader to minde, and he may know whether a man doth adde unto this Book, or take from it; for this is to be minded, that who ever doth undertake to be a Miniſter of Chriſt without a Commiſſion from him, or ſhall undertake to give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Scriptures, without having the gift of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; which gift he cannot have except he have a Commiſſion from God, or from him that did receive it from God.</p>
               <p>For how is it poſſible that any man ſhould give true interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Scriptures, and of that Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Saint <hi>John,</hi> and yet not know the true God, nor the right devil?</p>
               <p>Therefore it is for certain, that all Non-commiſſionated Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Speakers whatſoever in all the ſeven Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> I ſay, it is they onely that do add unto this Book, and they onely that do take from it.</p>
               <p>They may be ſaid to add to it, becauſe they give this, and that ſenſe upon the words of this Prophecy, even what their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doth dictate unto them, they being uncertain in themſelves that what they ſay to be true.</p>
               <p>So that who ever doth take upon him to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, &amp; to interprete the Scriptures without a Commiſsion from God, or that knowledge aforeſaid, I ſay ſuch men as thoſe may be ſaid to add unto the words of the Prophecy of this Book of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62818:127"/>
                  <hi>Revelation;</hi> and not only ſo, but to the whole Book of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>For all men that do undertake to be Miniſters and Preachers of Chriſt without a Commiſsion from him, they not being ſent by him, theſe men onely are thoſe that do add unto the Prophecy of this Book, that is, they add their own vain thoughts and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of their own imaginations unto the truths of God.</p>
               <p>So that in ſtead of the true meaning of the Scriptures, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have nothing elſe but the Preachers thoughts and conceivings of the Scriptures, and ſo are altogether unſatisfied in their ſpirits; and theſe are thoſe men that do add unto the Prophecy of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and to the Book of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>So in like manner will God add unto him, or them, the plagues that are written in this Book.</p>
               <p>Now what theſe plagues are, they are ſpoken of in this Book. The plagues that ſhall be added unto them, are ſpiritual, that is to ſay, ſpiritual darkneſs upon the minde here, and the fear of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death; ſo that the ſoul of man ſhall poſſeſs the ſecond death, which ſhall burn as a lake of fire and brimſtone in utter darkneſs, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth to eternity.</p>
               <p>Theſe are thoſe ſpiritual plagues that God will add to all thoſe men that go to be Preachers of his Goſpel, and were not ſent by him; for they onely do add unto the Prophecy of this Book.</p>
               <p>So that the Reader may ſee, what a dangerous thing it is for a man to take upon him to propheſie, preach, or teach as a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Chriſt without a Commiſsion from him.</p>
               <p>For who ever doth ſo, he doth add his own vain thoughts and imaginations in the Scriptures of thoſe Heavenly Secrets, Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Viſions declared by holy men, who were inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, or the revelation of Faith, to write thoſe things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; yet men by their own imaginations, by the gift of Learning, and by the natural wiſdom of Reaſon, will undertake to interprete Scriptures, and to be Preachers to others, without a Commiſsion from God, and without any true knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>And ſo theſe men do come to add other Interpretations of their own conceivings unto the Scriptures, which is contrary to the mind of that Spirit that writ them, and ſo they become capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of thoſe plagues that are written in this Book, as aforeſaid.</p>

            <div n="82" type="chapter">
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:62818:128"/>
               <head>CHAP. LXXXII.</head>
               <p>ALſo I would have the Reader to know, that the ſame men that do add their conceivings unto this book, the ſame ſort of men do take away from the words of this Book of this Prophecy.</p>
               <p>They may be ſaid to take away from it, in that they will not ſuffer any true Interpreter to expound the meaning of the words of the Prophecy of that Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> or any other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: onely this, ſome mens mindes are acted out one way, and ſome another; ſome men ſo they may be ſuffered to ſpeak their own phantaſies upon the Scriptures, ſo as to pleaſe themſelves and their Hearers, that is, they care not how much they add to this Book, not minding to take any thing from it.</p>
               <p>It is not their principles to take any thing from the Scriptures, but their delight is altogether to add their vain conceptions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the meaning thus, and thus.</p>
               <p>But he that taketh away from this Book, is ſuch a one that will not ſuffer the true Interpretation of the Scriptures, nor of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> becauſe the true Interpretation of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures overthroweth all the Principles of Religion in the world.</p>
               <p>So that if truth ſhould be ſuffered to have freedom in the world, then all the old Principles of Religion that have been received in the world ſo many hundred years by the Pope and others, they would quite fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>So that there is a neceſsity that there ſhould be a number of men to add unto this Book, and a number of men to take away from it.</p>
               <p>For true revelation always had ſome to add to it, and ſome to take from it: ſo that he that taketh from it, <hi>God will take his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy City, and from the things which are written in this Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is this, that as they would not ſuffer no true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Scriptures to abide in the world, but would take it quite away both the Interpretation, and the Interpreter alſo: So in like manner God will take his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy City, ſo that he ſhall have no part in that glory and everlaſting life which is written of in this Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, he thought by taking away from the words of this book, that is, by his perſecuting the true Interpretation of it, that he did
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62818:128"/>
God good ſervice, even as he did that added to it; for he that adds unto it, as aforeſaid, doth think he doth God good ſervice.</p>
               <p>So in like manner he that taketh from it, as aforeſaid, that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes true Revelation and true Interpretation, he doth think he doth God good ſervice in ſo doing, and ſo he thinks to have a part in the Book of Life, and to be one of the members of the holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to have a right to that glory and happineſs that is written in this Book; when as, (alas, alas,) he is one of them that hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the Prophecy of this Book, by perſecuting the true Interpretation of it; ſo that God hath taken away that part he thought he had in the Book of Life, and that confidence he had in being a member of the holy City, and of the glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>I ſay, all theſe things will God take away from thoſe men, that doth take away from the words of the Prophecy of this book of the Scriptures, and more eſpecially this book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Saint <hi>John.</hi> This is the true meaning of the Spirit, in adding and taking away from this Book of <hi>Johns Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh where is there a man hardly to be found, but he is guilty of one of theſe two, either to add, or to take away from this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Reader may ſee, what the Spirit doth mean by adding, and taking away, and who they are that doth this; for this is to be conſidered that no man can interpret the Scriptures truly, but he that is choſen and ſent of God, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and us the Witneſſes of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Alſo none can interpret the Scriptures truly, but thoſe that have the ſame Spirit, as thoſe had that ſpake the Scriptures; that ſpirit can trace the ſteps of God Almighty in thoſe three paths which God hath walked in: Thoſe three parths are Gods three Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or three Records on earth, to wit, the Water, Blood, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo that no Commiſſionated man of God can be ſaid either to add to, or diminiſh from the word of God; for he is choſen of God to reveal the myſteries of the kingdom unto his choſen ones, which myſteries are hidden in that letter.</p>
               <p>So that the meſſengers of God they ſhall be puniſhed of God, if they will not go forth to declare the myſteries of his kingdom: but on the contrary if men go, &amp; are not ſent of God, they are puniſhed of God, for going before they were ſent, and in going before they
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62818:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are ſent, they do add, and take away from the Scriptures, and from this book of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> for they being not choſen, nor ſent of God, they do not know the true meaning of the Scriptures, ſo they not knowing the truth of them, they add their own conceits, and ſenſes upon them, and diminiſh, and take away the true Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by perſecution, and will not ſuffer it to abide in the world, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt their own principles ſhould fall by it: and this is the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit, and what is meant by adding, and taking away from the words of the prophecy of this book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thought it ſomething neceſſary to open theſe two verſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been a thing common in moſt peoples mouths, when they have heard the interpretation of Scriptures, with many deep Secrets opened, and many heavenly Myſteries revealed, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was revealed before, or that hath not been commonly known amongſt Religious people, they have ſeemed hard ſayings.</p>
               <p>So that men have cryed out, O Blaſphemy, or elſe ſay, I have added to the word of God; or if the interpretation doth differ from the common received opinion, or interpretation.</p>
               <p>Then they will ſay, I take away from the word of God, yet they know not what it is to add, or to take away from it, therefore I have opened theſe two verſes in the laſt chapter, and the laſt verſes but one of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> that the Seed of Faith may know what it is, and who they are that add, and diminiſh the words of the prophecy of this book aforeſaid; and who it is that doth not add, nor diminiſh, but doth give the true interpretation of all the deep ſecrets, and hidden myſteries of the whole book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> And now laſt of all what it is to add, and take away, with the joy, and glory of them that doth not add, nor diminiſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with the plagues, ſhame, and miſery of all thoſe that doth add thereunto, or diminiſh there from.</p>
               <p>So much for the Interpretation of all the chief Head and hard ſayings in the whole book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the concluſion of this Epiſtle.</p>
